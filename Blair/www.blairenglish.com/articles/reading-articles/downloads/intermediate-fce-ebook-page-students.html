<p>In addition to this, you'll also find in the eBook a tried and tested method for using these reading exercises to improve your English quicker.</p> 
<p>The material in the eBook will last you for over 6 months of regular reading.
</p>
<br>

<h2>You can read it on any device</h2>

<p>Because it is a PDF eBook you can read it on any device which has a screen (a computer, mobile phone, tablet etc...).</p><br>



<h2>Why it isn't easy to find things to read in English</h2>

<p>If you really want to improve your English, <strong>you need to regularly read in English</strong>. The problem is that for somebody with your level of English, finding good things to read on the web isn't very easy. Most of the things you'll find will be for native speakers (and too difficult for you) and the articles which are for improving English will be too short and normally boring.</p>

<p>This is what my students who have an intermediate level of English or are studying for the Cambridge First Certificate in English (FCE) exam found. They wanted to read in English, but couldn't easily find material themselves. The result was that most of them just gave up looking and didn't read things in English.</p>

<h2>A solution</h2>

<p>To solve this problem for own my students, I decided to make my own material for them to read outside of class. Articles and pieces of writing that made it is easy for them to read regularly in English and helped them to improve their level in the language. Articles which were both interesting to read and on a variety of topics which would help them to expand their knowledge of English vocabulary.</p> 

<p>It's taken me over 2 years to create all of this reading material and to get it just right. And the result of all this hard work is this eBook.
</p>

<h2>How the eBook will help you</h2>
<p>The material in this eBook will help you quickly improve your English in a number of different areas:</p>

<h3>Improve your reading</h3>
<p>Each reading exercise has a text that been specifically written and adapted (so you won't find them confusing to read) for people whose level of English is intermediate or are studying for the Cambridge FCE exam. The texts in the eBook gradually get more difficult, so your level will improve the more of them you read.</p>
<p>The texts also cover a wide range of different topics (from science to art and everything in between) and this will expand your knowledge of English vocabulary.</p>
<h3>Improve your vocabulary</h3>
<p>In addition to the text, each reading exercise contains a vocabulary exercise. In this, you will learn the meaning of 7 carefully selected phrases and words from the text. These are words and phrases which I have noticed over the 10 years that I have been teaching English that students at your level commonly don't know, don't use or use incorrectly.</p>
<h3>Make you remember the vocabulary</h3>
<p>To make sure that you remember the words and phrases you learn in the vocabulary exercise, each reading exercise comes with a page for you to write a sentence in your own words for each of the 7 words and phrases you learnt in the vocabulary exercise.</p>
<br>

<h2>Get your copy now</h2>
<p>The cost for this eBook is €10 (around $12). When you take into consideration how long it will take you to read all the material (over 6 months) and how much it will help you improve your English, it is cheap for the price.</p>

<p>I've been giving my own students these reading exercises for three years now and I'm very happy with the results I've seen. Not only with seeing how it has improved their level of English, but seeing how much they enjoy the topics of the reading exercises that they always want to talk about what they've read in class.</p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">We all know that reading regularly in English is one of the best ways to get our students to improve their level in English (it broadens their vocabulary, it reinforces their knowledge of grammatical structures etc...). The problem is getting our students to actually do it.</p>

<p>In every class I've taught, I've always stressed the importance to them to read as much as possible outside of class in English. Unfortunately, apart from the most dedicated, few seldom do.</p>

<p>If you are an English learner, <a href="proficiency-cpe-ebook-page-students.html" > <strong><u>click here to learn about the student version of this eBook</u></strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Why they don't</h2>

<p>It can be easy to put the blame on our students for not doing this. And it is true that many of them (like all of us) can be either too lazy or are just too busy to get around to reading things in English outside the class.</p>

<p>But finding the right things to read is actually quite difficult and time-consuming. Although they do now have unlimited access to literally billions of articles in English which they can read for free on the web, it can be difficult for learners at this level to find articles themselves which both broaden their vocabulary and are interesting to read. So, it's unsurprising the majority of them don't bother reading or only read articles on topics where they already have a good command of the English vocabulary used in them. Neither of which helps them in improving and expanding their knowledge of the language.</p>


<h2>It makes our lives more difficult</h2>
<p>Although it may not seem like it is our problem as teachers whether our students regularly read in English outside of class, it is. The practice which our students do in English outside of class is as important as what they do with us in class for determining how quickly they progress. The less they practise their English, the slower they progress.</p>

<p>To overcome this, I decided to create my own material for them to read regularly and a method that ensured that they actually read it. Material which was not only right for their level, but also interesting for them to read. It's taken me about 2 years to create all of this and to get it just right. And the result of all this hard work, is this eBook.</p>
<br>

<p>In addition to this, you'll also find in the eBook a tried and tested method for using these reading exercises with your students.</p>
<br>

<h2>How the eBook will help you and your students</h2>

<p>The material in this eBook will improve your students' English in a number of different areas:</p> 
 
<h3>Improve their reading</h3>
<p>Each reading exercise has a text that been specifically written and adapted for people whose level of English is proficiency (or high advanced) or are studying for the Cambridge CPE exam. The texts cover a wide range of different topics (from science to art and everything in between) and this will broaden your students' knowledge of English vocabulary.</p>



<h3>Improve their vocabulary</h3>
<p>In addition to the text, each reading exercise contains a vocabulary exercise. In this, your students will learn the meaning of 7 carefully selected phrases and words from the text. These are words and phrases which I have noticed over that students at your level commonly don't know, don't use or use incorrectly.</p>

<h3>Make them remember the vocabulary</h3>
<p>It would be pointless for your students to learn the meaning of these words and phrases and then forget what they mean. To ensure that they do remember them, each reading exercise comes with a sheet for your students to write a sentence in their own words for each of the 7 words and phrases they learnt in the vocabulary exercise.</p>

<h3>It'll help their speaking as well</h3> 
<p>These reading exercises have also been designed to improve your students' ability and confidence in speaking in English as well. The topic of each reading exercise has been selected to make students interested in what they are reading about. Included in the eBook is a tried and tested method for using the reading exercises for getting your students to talk together in class, not just about the text, but about the topic in general. To help you do this, you'll find each reading exercise has a list of at least 5 questions which you can ask them after they have done it.</p>  

<p>You'll be surprised how much your students' speaking in English will improve after doing these reading exercises for just a few months.</p>

<h3>Make your life easier</h3>
<p>The more your students read and speak in English, the quicker they improve. This makes happier students, happier classes and higher grades. All of which makes your life as teacher a lot easier.</p>
<br>

<h2>Get your copy now</h2>

<p>The cost for all of this material is <strong>€17 (around $20)</strong>. When you take into consideration that the material is designed to be used for a full academic year and how much it will help both you and your students, it is cheap for the price.</p>

<p>I have been using this material and method with my own students for over three years now and I'm very happy with the results I've seen. Not only with seeing how it has improved their level of English, but seeing how they enjoy speaking together and expressing their opinions about the topics of the reading exercises that they have done.</p>

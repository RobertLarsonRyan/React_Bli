<p class="openParaArticle">Sometimes you will have to call a company/organisation and not have a name of a person you want to speak to. This is more difficult for non-native speakers of English than <a href="../../../../../exercises/telephone/exercises/english-telephone-phrases-calling-somebody-directly/english-telephone-phrases-calling-somebody-directly.html"><b><u>calling somebody directly</u></b></a> (on their phone or mobile/cell) or <a href="../../../../../exercises/telephone/exercises/english-telephone-phrases-asking-speak-to-somebody/english-telephone-phrases-asking-speak-to-somebody.html"><b><u>asking to speak to somebody on a phone call</u></b></a>, because at the beginning of the conversation you have to explain what you want.</p>


<p>But if you are prepared for not only what you have to say, but also for what questions you will be asked by the person who you will speak to, it makes making these types of phone calls a lot easier to do.</p> 

<p>In the below exercise on English telephone phrases, you will learn and remember phrases and vocabulary you can use when calling a company/organisation but you don't have a name of somebody you want to speak to. In addition, you will learn what people will ask you in these types of telephone conversations.</p>

<p>Although the below examples are business calls, you can use and hear the phrases in them when you make calls for non-business reasons (e.g. to contact your bank etc...) as well.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: </h2>
 
 <p>In each of the two following conversations, a person is calling a company. Although both are very similar, there are differences in what the caller asks for.</p> <p>In the first, the caller wants to speak to somebody in a specific department. In the second, the caller only gives the reason why they are calling.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are and when you should use them in a telephone call. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p> 

 
 <h3>Telephone Call 1:</h3>
 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Good morning. Ward Computers. How can I help you?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Good morning. <strong>I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please</strong>.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'May I ask what it's regarding?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>It's regarding</strong> an order which we recently made with yourselves.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Can I ask who's calling, please?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Of course. <strong>My name's</strong> Simon Ward and <strong>I'm calling from</strong> Hughes Systems.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If you'd just hold the line for a minute, I'll see if somebody is available.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No problem.'
</span></p>

 <p class="timePhraseExercise">
Two minutes later</p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Thank you for holding the line. I'll put you through to somebody in the sales department.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Thank you.'
</span></p><br>

   
 
 <h3>Telephone Call 2:</h3>

<p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Good afternoon. Gordon and Smith Supplies. How can I help you?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Good afternoon. <strong>I'd like to speak to somebody about an order, please</strong>.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Are you wanting to place an order?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, <strong>I'm calling about</strong> an order which we recently made with yourselves.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Can I take your name, please?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'My name's John Smith and I'm calling from Shelbourne School.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Receptionist:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Would you mind holding the line while I see if anybody is available?
'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Caller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>No problem</strong>.'

  <p><strong>I'm calling from:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> When you are calling a company or organisation, you will always be asked after the person has asked for the reason you are calling, who you are.</p> <p>If it is a business call you are making, after you have given your name you should say which company or organisation you work for. This is what the phrase 'I'm calling from' is used to do.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'My name's Simon Pecker and I'm calling from Easy Software.'</p>

<div id="n2">
<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n2')"> 
<tr> 
<td>  
  <p><strong>I'm calling about:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> When you are calling a company or organisation, one of the first things they will ask you is why you are calling. One phrase that you can use to start explaining the reason is 'I'm calling about'. You would follow this by explaining the reason.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'May I ask what it's regarding?'
<br><br>
'I'm calling about an email we received from your company.'
<br><br>
In addition to 'I'm calling about', you can also use 'it's about', 'it's regarding' or 'it's concerning' to tell the person the reason for the call when asked. All of these have the same meaning, but 'it's about' sounds less formal and both 'it's regarding' and 'it's concerning' sound a little more formal.
<br><br>
But unlike the others, you can also use 'I'm calling about' to give the reason for the phone call before the other person asks you to. If you want to tell them the reason for the call before they ask you, you would normally do this after you have told them who you are and where you work. 
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'My name's John Doe from Panda Care. I'm calling about an email we received from your company.'</p>

<select name="s3"  ID="q3"  onClick="Engine(1)" >
<option value="1"></option>
<option value="I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please">I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please</option>

  <p><strong>No problem:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em>  On many phone calls, you will be asked to wait (hold the line) when the person you are speaking to does something (e.g. speak to somebody, see if a person is available to take your call etc...). When they do this, it is polite to reply by saying 'no problem' (which means 'that's ok').
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'If you'd just hold the line for a minute, I'll see if somebody is available.'
<br><br>

<option value="I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please">I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please</option>

If you don't have a name, then you either have to say what your call is about or what department you want to be transferred to.
<br><br>
The phrase 'I'd like to speak to somebody about an order, please' is used when you tell the person what your call is about. In this example, the person is calling about 'an order'. When you use this phrase, change this to whatever you are calling them about (e.g. an advertisement, an invoice, changing a password etc...).
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'I'd like to speak to somebody about an invoice we received, please.'
<br><br>
Another way to say this phrase is 'can I speak to somebody about an invoice we received, please'. Although less formal than 'I'd like to...', it is perfectly fine to use in most business calls.
<br><br>
Sometimes they may ask you for more information on why you are calling. If they do, you would start explaining why you are calling by using 'it's regarding', 'it's concerning' or 'I'm calling about'.</p>

Normally if it is a business call you are making, directly after you have given your name you should say which company or organisation you work for.

<br><br>
The phrase 'I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please' is used when you tell the person what department you want to be transferred to. In this example, the person wants to speak to somebody in the 'sales department'. When you use it, you can change it to whatever department or section you want to speak to (e.g. human resources, the accounts department etc...).
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'I'd like to speak to somebody in human resources, please.'

Another way to say this phrase is 'can I speak to somebody in human resources, please'. Although less formal than 'I'd like to...', it is perfectly fine to use in most business calls.</p>

<p>7. Another way to explain to the person the reason why you are calling than saying '
I'm calling about', is to start by saying<br>
<select name="s7"  ID="q7"  onClick="Engine(1)" >
<option value="1"></option>
<option value="It's regarding">It's regarding</option>
<option value="I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please">I'd like to speak to somebody in the sales department, please</option>
<option value="No problem">No problem</option>
</select>

<a href="javascript:showObject7();" tabindex="-1"><img src="../../../../../images/icons/blank.gif" class="testImage20" ID="info7" border="0" onClick="changeZindex('n7')" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="javascript:showObjectAudio(7);" tabindex="-1"><img src="../../../../../images/icons/blank.gif" class="testImage20" ID="audio7" border="0" onClick="changeZindex('p7')" /></a>
<div id="n7">
<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n7')"> 
<tr> 
<td>  
  <p><strong>It's regarding:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> When you are calling a company or organisation, one of the first things they will ask you is why you are calling. One phrase that you can use to start explaining the reason is 'it's regarding'. You would follow this by explaining the reason.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'May I ask what it's regarding?'
<br><br>
'It's regarding an invoice that we still haven't received payment on.'
<br><br>
In addition to 'it's regarding', you can also use 'it's concerning', 'I'm calling about' or 'it's about' to explain the reason you are calling. Although 'I'm calling about' or 'it's about' sound a little less formal than 'it's regarding' or 'it's concerning', they are perfectly fine to use in business phone calls.
<br><br>
Unlike 'I'm calling about', you can only use 'it's regarding' (and both 'it's about' and 'it's concerning') to give the reason only after the the other person has asked you for the reason for your call (e.g. 'May I ask what it's regarding/concerning?').

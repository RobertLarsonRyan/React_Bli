<p class="openParaArticle">This is the second part of two online exercises on learning what to say on phone calls in English when the person you call isn't there or can't talk with you. In addition to learning more English vocabulary and phrases used when somebody can't talk to you when you call, in this part you will learn what to say when you want to leave a message for the person and how to say it.</p> 



<p>It doesn't matter if you do this or <a href="../../../../../exercises/telephone/exercises/english-telephone-phrases-person-you-call-not-there-part-1/english-telephone-phrases-person-you-call-not-there-part-1.html"><strong><u>the first part of this exercise</u></strong></a> first. But I would  recommend that you do both, because they will prepare you for everything you could be asked if this happens to you and what you have to say.</p>  
   
     
<p>Like with the first part of this exercise, it is focused on helping you know what to expect and say in these situations, so the beginning of each telephone conversation is not included. To learn what you need to say in English to start a telephone conversation, do the following exercises:</p>

 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>In each of the two following telephone conversations, a receptionist tells a caller that the person/people who they are calling for can't speak to them. In the first dialogue, the person they are calling for can't speak to them, but the receptionist doesn't say why. In the second, all the people in the department the caller wants to speak to are busy.
 </p>
 
 <p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are and when you should use them in a telephone call. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>

To do this, you use the phrase 'Is there anybody else who I could speak to about'. You would then follow it by saying what it is that you are calling about (e.g. change your account details, make a complaint, place an order etc...).
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'Is there anybody else who I could speak to about changing my account details?'
<br><br>
The person you are speaking to may say there is or there isn't.

<br><br>
Another phrase which you could here which basically has the same meaning is:
<br><br>
'I'm afraid they are all currently on other calls at the moment'.
<br><br>
After they say this, the person will normally ask you if you want to wait. If after waiting for 2 to 5 minutes nobody is still available to take your call, they will ask you if you want to call back later, be called back by somebody in the department/team or continue waiting.

  <p><strong>So that's:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> When you leave a message with somebody, they will often repeat to you what you have said to make sure that they have got it right. When they do this, they may start by using the phrase "so that's" before repeating the information you have given them.
<br><br>
This phrase is most often used when repeating the phone number you are leaving and repeating the spelling of your name if you have had to spell it out to them because it is unusual. For example:
<br><br>
'So that's 78567564?'
<br><br>
'So that's Simon G R E G G?'
<br><br>
After they have said this, you have to confirm if what they have said is correct by saying "that's right". If it isn't right, you would correct them. And you would start to do this by saying "no, it's...".

<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n4')"> 
<tr> 
<td>  
  <p><strong>Do you know how long it will be until somebody is available:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em>  It is common when you call a company or organisation that you will have to wait until someone is available to take your call. If they are busy, you could be waiting for a long time. If this happens, the person who transferred you into the telephone queue, will normally speak to you again to apologise for the wait.
<br><br>
To ask them how much more time you will have to wait, you can use this phrase. 
<br><br>
This phrase is for when you want to speak to someone but don't know who it will be (someone in a department/team). But you can use the same phrase with a small change if you are calling for a specific person who is there, but is busy when you call. Simply change 'somebody' for 'he' or 'she'.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>

  <p><strong>Could you spell that, please:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em>  When you leave a message for someone, if your name is unusual in the country you are calling, you will probably be asked to spell it for the person who is taking it. If they want you to spell it, they will use this phrase after you have told them it. For example:
<br><br>
'Tell her that Juan Montes has called.'
<br><br>
'Could you spell that, please?'
<br><br>
After that you would say what the letters of your names are. Before you spell them out, you should say which is your first name and which is your surname. For example:

  <p><strong>I'm afraid she is currently unavailable:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a common phrase that is used when the person you want to talk to can't take your call. When this is used, it means that the person is in the place you are calling, but is doing something which means they can't talk to you (e.g. they are in a meeting etc...) or doesn't want to talk to you (e.g. they are avoiding you or are busy doing something else).
<br><br>
If the reason is a good one (e.g. they are in a meeting), they may say why they can't talk to you at that moment. But often they will say they won't and just say they are unavailable.
<br><br>
Another phrase which has a similar meaning and you also hear used is 'I'm afraid she's currently away from her desk'.

  <p><strong>That's right:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> When you leave a message with somebody, they will often repeat to you what you have said to make sure that they have got it right. When they do this, you need to confirm what they have is right or wrong.
<br><br>
To confirm that it is correct, you would say the phrase 'that's right' or 'that's correct'.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'So that's 78567564?'
<br><br>
'That's right.'
<br><br>
If it isn't right, you would correct them. And you would start to do this by saying, "no, it's..." and stress (say louder and for longer) the part which they have incorrect.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'So that's 78568564?'

'No, it's 78567564.'

After this, you can leave your phone number with the person you are talking to, so they can include it in the message. You can do this by saying, 'my phone number is...' or 'they can contact me on...'. You can also say what time(s) you can be contacted at or by. For example, 'I'll be in the office until 5pm'.

<p class="openParaArticle">When you call a company or organisation and ask to speak to somebody (either when you have a name of somebody you want to speak to or you don't have one), often the person or somebody won't be able to talk to you when you call.</p>  
   
<p>If this happens, it can be very confusing if your first language isn't English. Not only can there be a number of different reasons why the person or somebody can't speak to you (the person is not there, they are speaking to somebody else on the phone etc...), but there are also a number of different things that you can do or be asked by the person you are speaking to about what you want to do (e.g. call them back later, leave a message for them etc...).</p>  

<p>But if you are prepared for these situations before you call, you'll know both what you could be asked and (more importantly) what to say. Making you more confident before you make any phone call in English.</p>

<p>To help you know what to say when the person you call isn't there or can't speak to you, I have created two online exercises on English telephone phrases for you. In these you will learn different phrases and vocabulary that are used for this situation. In addition, you will learn and remember what you can say when this happens.</p>

<p>This exercise is the first of two exercises on what to say if the person you call isn't there. In <a href="../../../../../exercises/telephone/exercises/english-telephone-phrases-person-you-call-not-there-part-2/english-telephone-phrases-person-you-call-not-there-part-2.html"><strong><u>the second part of this exercise</u></strong></a>, you will learn what to say when you want to leave a message.</p>

<p>This exercise focuses on helping you know what to expect and say in these situations, so the beginning of each telephone conversation is not included. To learn what you need to say in English to start a telephone conversation, do the following exercises:</p>

<ul>

 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>In each of the two following telephone conversations, a receptionist tells a caller that the person who they are calling for can't speak to them. In the first conversation, the person they are calling for is not there. In the second, the person is speaking to somebody else on a another call.</p>
 
 <p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are and when you should use them in a telephone call. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>

  <p><strong>I'll call back later:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is commonly used when the person you want to speak to or people who can help you are not available and you say that you will call again later in the day. 
<br><br>
Normally, before saying this you would ask 'Do you know when she/he'll be back?' or 'Do you know how long I'll have to wait?' depending on the situation.
<br><br>
Instead of using 'call', you can also use 'phone' and outside of America 'ring' in this phrase without any change in meaning. 
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'I'll ring back later.'

Instead of using 'out of the office', they may explain where the person is (e.g. 'he is visiting a client', 'she is at lunch' etc...), but this is less common.
<br><br>
After they have said this, you can ask when they will return by saying: 'Do you know when they'll back?'. If you don't say this, the person you are speaking to will normally ask you if you want to leave a message, call back later etc...
<br><br>
This phrase is only used if the person is expected to return later in that day. If the person is not going to return that day or is away for more days, they will say something different (e.g. 'she is on holiday at the moment', 'he is on a business trip' etc...).

'Would you like to ask him to call you back?' is one of these. If you say you would, the person will tell the person you called and ask them to call you back.

  <p><strong>Could I take his mobile number:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> If the person you want to speak to is out of the office or the place you are calling, you can ask for their mobile ('cell' in North America) phone number to contact them. Although you can do this, most companies and organisations won't give the mobile/cell phone numbers of its employees out to people calling in. So, it is likely that the person you are speaking to will say they can't and ask you to leave them a message and contact details and then they will contact them.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'Could I take his mobile number?'
<br><br>
'I'm afraid I can't give you that, sir. Would you like to leave a message and I will pass it onto him?'

<br><br>
After they say either of these, the person will normally ask you if you want to wait. If after waiting for 2 to 5 minutes the person is still on the phone, they will ask you if you want to leave a message, call back later or be called back by the person you want to speak.

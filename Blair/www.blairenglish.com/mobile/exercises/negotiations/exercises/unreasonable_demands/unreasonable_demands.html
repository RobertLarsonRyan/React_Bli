<p class="openParaArticle">In business negotiations, people can be unreasonable. Sometimes, one side/party can be very aggressive and try to force the other side/party to accept an offer which isn't beneficial for them. In other situations, one side/party will refuse to make any concessions on an offer they have made.</p>



<p>Normally, there are two outcomes when this happens:
<ul class="spacedLists" >
<li>Negotiations break down (finish without agreement).</li> 

<li>One side/party accepts an unfavourable offer.</li>
</ul>

<p>In either outcomes, it will probably damage the relationship between the two people involved and even the two companies. Which is not ideal for the future.</p>

<p>So what can you do if you are negotitaing with somebody who isn't willing to compromise? Get angry and/or give up?</p>

<p>There are ways in which you (whether you are the buyer or the seller) can deal with or control these situations to prevent negotiations breaking down, turning into an argument or having to accept a deal which is bad for you. It all depends on what you say and what you are prepared to do.</p>

<p>In this online exercise on negotiations, we will both look at and I will explain the purpose of certain phrases in English which are used in business negotiations to deal with unreasonable demands/offers and behaviour. Some of these phrases can be used by buyers in a negotiation and others by sellers.</p>


<p>After you have done this exercise, you can also improve your knowledge of both strategies and vocabulary to use in our online exercises for other negotiation situations. These include <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/delaying/delaying.html"><u><strong>delaying in neogiations</strong></u></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/making_a_deal/making_a_deal.html"><u><strong>making a deal in neogiations</strong></u></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/selling_positives/selling_positives.html"><u><strong>convincing people to buy</strong></u></a>.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Dealing with unreasonable demands</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following two business negotiations where one side/party is being unreasonable in its demands or behaviour. In the first, the re-negotiation is for a service contract for IT support. In the second, the negotiation is for a contract for television components.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 

 <h3>Negotiation One</h3>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'For a 2 year extension to the current service contract, the price will be $5 million.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's a lot higher than what we paid for the current contract.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'To be honest, we've made a lost on the current contract with you. We've looked at the numbers and we can't lower it.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Let me just make sure I know what you're saying</strong>, for exactly the same contract as we have now, we'll have to pay $1.5 million more.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'As I said before, we've lost money on the existing contract we have with you. Plus, consider how much time and money it will cost you to change to a new service provider, at least $2 million and hundreds of hours of training and business downtime.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I don't think that I'll be able to sell this</strong> back at head office.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'As I said, to set up with a new provider will cost you more with higher risk.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>What would you do in our position</strong> if you had to pay 30% more to extend an existing contract?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I appreciate how you feel. It does seem a lot, but it'll cost you more if you change.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>What do you think will happen if we don't agree</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I suppose that you'll decide to give the contract to someone else.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, <strong>would you prefer to lose the contract or make a concession</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Of course, we don't want to lose the contract, but we feel we've made you a very reasonable offer.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So you won't consider making a concession on price?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'm afraid it's the lowest price we can offer you.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, if that's your position, <strong>I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do</strong>! I think it's better if we finish the meeting now. <strong>If you reconsider your position, get in touch with me</strong>.'</span></p>
 <br>
 
    
    
 <h3>Negotiation Two</h3>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'From our perspective, $4.35 per component is too much. We're not willing to pay more than $3.00 per component.'</span></p>
  
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>So, if I understand you correctly, you're looking for</strong> $3.00 per unit for an order of 40,000 per month.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Would you excuse us for a moment</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No problem.'</span></p>
   
 <p class="timePhraseExercise">10 minutes later</p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Your offer is very low. For that price we would make a loss on each component we sold you. It wouldn't make any sense for us to agree to a contract with these terms.'
</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We have found two suppliers who are willing to offer that price.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But will they provide the same quality of product and guarantee of service and delivery?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>What if we offered</strong> you each component at $4.15 on condition that you increased your order to 50.000 per month?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I appreciate the offer, but we're only prepared to pay $3. You do know that prices of televisions fell by 15% last year. We need to cut costs I'm afraid. So, are you willing to accept our offer?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I understand what you're saying</strong>, but we simply couldn't do it. It would ruin us. <strong>How do you suggest we proceed</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I appreciate how you see it and I would like to make a compromise, but we have to save money somewhere!'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I think it's best if we have a few days to think about it.'</span></p>

<h2>Quiz:</h2>
<p>Below is a definition/description of each of the words/phrases in <b>bold</b> from the above text. Now choose the word/phrase from the question's selection box which you believe answers each question. Only use one word/phrase once. Click on the <b>"Check"</b> button at the bottom of the quiz to check your answers.</p>
<p>When the answer is correct, two icons will appear below the answer. The "<img src="../../../../../images/icons/info_icon.gif" class="testImage25" align="absmiddle" id="infoInstruct" />" icon contains <b>extra information</b> on the word/phrase. In the "<img src="../../../../../images/icons/audio_icon111.gif" class="testImage25" align="absmiddle" id="audioInstruct" />" icon, you can listen to the <b>pronunciation</b> of the word/phrase.</p>

    

<FORM>
<p>1. A polite phrase that asks for 'a short pause in the negotiation' to enable you to think about what you are going to do next, is <br>
<select name="s1"  ID="q1"  onClick="Engine(1)" > 
<option value="1"></option>
<option value="I don't think that I'll be able to sell this">I don't think that I'll be able to sell this</option>

<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n1')"> 
<tr> 
<td> 
  <p><strong>Would you excuse us for a moment:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase can be used by both buyers and sellers. It is a very polite phrase. In the context of a difficult negotiation when somebody has made an unreasonable demand or offer, it is recommended that before you overreact or make a deal which is unfavourable for you, you should leave the negotiation for a short time in order to think about how you should continue. This phrase is ideal to do this. There are other phrases that can be used for the same purpose, e.g. 'I need to use the toilet'. In Spanish: <em><b>"Nos disculpa un momento, por favor"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>What would you do in our position:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase can be used by both buyers and sellers. It is basically asking the other side/party for advice. Although it seems strange to do so, the other side/party will probably see it has a compliment that you're asking them. It is often asked to the side/party that is being unreasonable and refusing to make any concessions. It can make them appreciate more your situation and make them more willing to make a concession. Plus, you can gain useful information from their answer. In Spanish: <em><b>"qué haría usted en nuestra posición"</b></em>.</p>

<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n3')">

<td> 
  <p><strong>What if we offered:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase can be used by both buyers and sellers. It is used to introduce a concession to a previous offer you have made, e.g. 'what if we offered a price of  $200?'. It has the same meaning as 'what would  you say if'. In both, it sounds like you're making the concession because of the actions or demands of the other side/party, although you may have intended to make this concession before negotiations even started. It's a very effective and persuasive phrase. In Spanish: <em><b>"qué tal si ofrecemos"</b></em>.</p>

In the context of this exercise, it's is used when  the other side/party are not willing at all to compromise and you have the feeling that nothing is going to happen or it will turn into an argument.  It's polite because of 'I'm afraid'. This phrase is used to stop the negotiation. It often follows the phrase 'if that's your position, then...' . It should only be used if there's no alternative.

  <p><strong>Let me just make sure I know what you're saying:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase can be used by both buyers and sellers. It is used to show suprise (in a bad way) at an offer the other side/party has made to you and to get them to confirm that your understanding of it is correct. After saying it, you say the main points of the offer which the other side/party has just made. When the offer or demand is unreasonable, this phrase is often used with the purpose of both making the other person aware of how unreasonable it is and giving you a little time to think how you should respond to the offer.

It's similar to 'What would you do in our position', but the answer will be focused on the actions of both sides/parties. Although it seems strange to do so, the other side/party will probably see it has a compliment that you're asking them. It is often asked to the side/party that is being unreasonable and refusing to make any concessions. It can make them appreciate more your situation and make them more willing to make a concession. Plus, you can gain useful information from their answer. In Spanish: <em><b>"cómo sugiere que procedamos"</b></em>.</p>

You would answer this with 'I understand what you're saying'. It is normally followed by 'but' where you explain to them the reasons or benefits of the offer/product etc..., e.g. 'but it lasts at least 2 years longer than other products on the market'. This phrase is used to calm the situation and show that you are both listening to them and can understand their point/position. It's very effective.

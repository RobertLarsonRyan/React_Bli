<p class="openParaArticle">Negotiation is the art of improving what you can obtain. It is a fundamental skill to have in business today. Everybody wants to obtain the best deal possible when they negotiate, either for themselves or for their company.</p>

<p>There are different techniques/strategies you can use when you want to do this when negotiating in English. You can use persuasion, force or logic. The one you choose depends on who you are negotiating with and how they respond to what you say.</p>

<p>In this online exercise on negotiations, we will both look at and I will explain the purpose of certain phrases in English which are used in business negotiations when people want to improve their side of a deal. In addition, we will also look at how to react to these, and how to suggest a compromise.</p>

<p>After you have done this exercise, you can also improve your knowledge of both strategies and vocabulary to use in our online exercises for other negotiation situations. These include <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/delaying/delaying.html"><u><strong>delaying in neogiations</strong></u></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/unreasonable_demands/unreasonable_demands.html"><u><strong>dealing with unreasonable demands in negotiations</strong></u></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/selling_positives/selling_positives.html"><u><strong>convincing people to buy</strong></u></a>.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Negotiating price</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following negotiation between a television manufacturer and a components company for a two-year contract for components. Bill is representing the television company and Fleur is representing the component company.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Fleur:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, we could supply you with 40,000 components per month, for a two-year period at a unit cost of $4.35 per component.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Bill:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>There seems to have been a slight misunderstanding</strong>. You do realise that we want to order nearly a million components. And for that quantity, the price per unit does seem to be very high.'</span></p> 
    
 <p><span class="names">Fleur:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We have taken into account the size of the order you require. And we have reduced the unit price markedly from what we normally ask.  In terms of unit price, <strong>what were you thinking of</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Bill:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, <strong>we were hoping for something</strong> around $3.40 per unit. Please bear in mind that we want to order nearly a million components, not a thousand.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Fleur:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'$3.40 per unit. <strong>I am afraid that is out of the question</strong>. If we sold it to you at that price, we would be making loss on every unit sold.'</span></p>
     
  <p><span class="names">Bill:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, <strong>we have received a quote</strong> from one of your competitors at $3.53 per unit.'</span></p>
  
        
  <p><span class="names">Fleur:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I am afraid that we can't match that</strong>. But if I were you, I would be asking myself how can they sell the components at such a low price? I would say that they are sacrificing the quality of the component for price.  But <strong>there may be some room for manoeuvre</strong>. If you were to increase your order to 50,000 components per month, then we could lower the unit cost to $4.15.'</span></p>
    
  <p><span class="names">Bill:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'For 50,000 units per month <strong>we wouldn't expect to pay more than</strong> $3.85 per unit. I would say that this price is the <strong>going rate</strong> for the quantity.'</span></p>
     
  <p><span class="names">Fleur:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I don't think that we could go that far</strong>. Under $4 per unit. It's too low.'</span></p>
     
  <p><span class="names">Bill:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, <strong>could you meet us halfway</strong>? At $4 per unit?'</span></p>      
     
   <p><span class="names">Fleur:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If that's $4 per unit, 50,000 per month for 2 years. I think we can do that.'</span></p>

<h2>Quiz:</h2>
<p>Below is a definition/description of each of the words/phrases in <b>bold</b> from the above text. Now choose the word/phrase from the question's selection box which you believe answers each question. Only use one word/phrase once. Click on the <b>"Check"</b> button at the bottom of the quiz to check your answers.</p>

  <p><strong>I am afraid that is out of the question:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> Although this phrase is polite, it's also direct. It is used in negotiations to reject a suggestion, offer or request that somebody has made. 'It's out of the question' is too direct to be used in most business situations. But by adding the phrase 'I'm afraid that', it makes the phrase sound a lot politer. In Spanish: <em><b>"Me temo que esto no es posible"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>What were you thinking of:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a politer way to say  'What do you want?' It can be used in negotiations to ask about price, service, quantity etc... It is used when the other side/party has rejected an offer that you have made. The use of the past verb 'were' instead of the present verb 'are', makes a subtle but important difference. If the other side/party responds to this question with 'we were thinking of', then it means that they are willing to negotiate or make compromises, because they are using the past and not present tense.

  <p><strong>We were hoping for something:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a politer way to say 'we want to pay' and is normally used by the side/party buying the goods or service. The use of both the verb 'to hope' and the past tense of the verb means they are willing to negotiate and make a compromise. This is normally followed by 'around' and a price, e.g. 'we were hoping for something around $1 million for 2 years'.  In Spanish: <em><b>"esperábamos"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>I am afraid that we can't match that:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> Often in negotiations the side/party that wants to buy, will say that they have received a quote/price from another company. If the seller can offer the same price/conditions, then it's common to say 'we can match that'. If they can't or won't, then they use 'we can't match that'. The use of 'I'm afraid that', makes it sound politer.  In Spanish: <em><b>"me temo que no podemos igualarlo"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>We wouldn't expect to pay more than:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> Although this phrase appears to set a limit on what one side/party is willing to pay for a good or service, by using 'we wouldn't expect', it actually means that they could be willing to pay more than the limit if they are offered a better price, service, quality, quantity etc...  from the other side/party. This phrase can also be used by the side/party selling the goods/services, e.g. 'We wouldn't expect to receive less than $1.5 million for the contract'.

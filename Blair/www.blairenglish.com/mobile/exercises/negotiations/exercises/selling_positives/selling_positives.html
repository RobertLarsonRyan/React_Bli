<p class="openParaArticle">Often in negotiations you'll face a situation where the other side/party don't believe that an offer that you have made is beneficial for them. Maybe they think that the price is too high or it doesn't include something which they believe is important.</p>

<p>It can be tempting to reduce the price. But there is another way. And that is to convince them of the benefits and positive aspects of both your offer and selecting the products or services from your company. To do this, you need to be subtle, connect with them on a personal level and show empathy for their position.</p>

<p>In this online exercise on negotiations, we will both look at and I will explain the purpose of subtle and persuasive phrases in English which a seller can use in a business negotiation to convince/persuade the buyer to select their offer/company.</p>

<p>After you have done this exercise, you can also improve your knowledge of both strategies and vocabulary to use in our online exercises for other negotiation situations. These include <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/delaying/delaying.html"><u><strong>delaying in neogiations</strong></u></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/making_a_deal/making_a_deal.html"><u><strong>making a deal in neogiations</strong></u></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/negotiations/exercises/unreasonable_demands/unreasonable_demands.html"><u><strong>dealing with unreasonable demands in negotiations</strong></u></a>.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Selling the positives in a negotiation</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following business negotiation between a seller and potential buyer for a contract to supply television components to a television manufacturer. The buyer is negotiating for a better price.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, we can offer you 40,000 components at a unit cost of $4.35 per unit.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'$4.35 per unit. Hmm.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You don't seem entirely pleased. <strong>Could I ask you what the issue is</strong>?'</span></p>
  
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We weren't expecting the price to be so high.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's an extremely competitive price for the quality of the component that you'll be getting.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'As you are aware, <strong>we've had a number of different offers</strong> and in comparison with those, the price that you're offering us is a lot higher.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I can understand why you're looking around</strong> other companies for offers. I would do the same. I recently concluded a negotiation for microcircuits and I was in your position. I visited so many different suppliers. It's a very <strong>time-consuming process</strong>. At times it feels like it'll never end.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah. I've been very busy with negotiating for this order for the last couple of weeks. This is the third meeting this week that I've had with a supplier about it. It's tiring.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I can appreciate how you feel</strong>.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's what we're paid for.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'True. Let's have a break.'</span></p>
    
<p class="timePhraseExercise">5 minutes later</p>

    
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Although you see the price is high, <strong>what I'd like you to consider</strong> is the quality of the product that you're obtaining. This component is not only the best built and most reliable on the market, it's also the most innovative and advanced. In fact, it won first prize at this year's Berlin TV component fair. So, <strong>what this gives you</strong> is the confidence that this component in two years time will still be at the cutting edge. Unfortunately, with some of the components on the market from other manufacturers, in six months they'll be obsolete.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's something that we have taken into consideration, but the price you're asking is very high.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Let's put the question of money to one side for the moment</strong>. You know that our company has one of the best reputations in the industry for not only the quality of the product and innovation, but also the quality control system in our factories. We have the lowest rate of returns of any company in the sector. <strong>So you know what you're getting</strong>, a cutting edge quality product with a negligible risk of failure.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The quality and innovation of the product is not in doubt. But the price is higher than we're willing to pay.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I understand that you see the price as a little high</strong>, and I'm sure that you've been offered less. But how much do you spend each year replacing faulty components? <strong>What would you say if </strong> we guaranteed each of the components not for the standard 3 years but for 5 years. Plus, if one of your televisions breaks down due to a failure of one of our components, we'll not only replace the component for free, but also cover your labour costs of repair.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, if I understand correctly, you offering a 5 year guarantee and you'll pay for all labour costs where one of your components has caused a television to break down?'
</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buyer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Hmm.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Seller:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Don't give me an answer straight away</strong>. Think about it and get back to me.'</span></p>

<h2>Quiz:</h2>
<p>Below is a definition/description of each of the words/phrases in <b>bold</b> from the above text. Now choose the word/phrase from the question's selection box which you believe answers each question. Only use one word/phrase once. Click on the <b>"Check"</b> button at the bottom of the quiz to check your answers.</p>
<p>When the answer is correct, two icons will appear below the answer. The "<img src="../../../../../images/icons/info_icon.gif" class="testImage25" align="absmiddle" id="infoInstruct" />" icon contains <b>extra information</b> on the word/phrase. In the "<img src="../../../../../images/icons/audio_icon111.gif" class="testImage25" align="absmiddle" id="audioInstruct" />" icon, you can listen to the <b>pronunciation</b> of the word/phrase.</p>

    

<FORM>
<p>1. A phrase that is used when you feel it is better for the negotiation to talk about something different with the other person, is  <br>
<select name="s1"  ID="q1"  onClick="Engine(1)" > 
<option value="1"></option>
<option value="I understand that you see the price as a little high">I understand that you see the price as a little high</option>

<tr> 
<td> 
  <p><strong>Let's put the question of money to one side for the moment:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase can be used by both buyers and sellers. This is commonly used when you want to change the topic or focus of a conversation. It's like saying 'can we stop talking about the money', but a lot politer.  It is a very formal and professional phrase. With the use of 'let's', it almost like you're asking the other person permission to do it.  You can replace 'money' with many other things, e.g. 'responsibility', 'cost', 'blame', 'insurance' etc... In Spanish: <em><b>"vamos a dejar la cuestión del dinero a un lado por el momento"</b></em>.</p>

What 'I can understand why you're looking around' does is give the opposite reaction to what the buyer is expecting, i.e. 'the seller doesn't panic'.

In both, it sounds like you're making the concession because of the actions or demands of the other side/party, although you may have intended to make this concession before negotiations even started. It's a very effective and persuasive phrase. In Spanish: <em><b>"qué diría si"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>I can appreciate how you feel:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase can be used by both buyers and sellers. It can be used in two ways. The first, is to calm a situation where the other side/party are starting to get angry or emotional. This phrase is used to show empathy for their situation. It is important when saying this to have a caring/compassionate tone of voice and  body language. If you don't, it will seem insincere and make the other person angrier.  The second, is very similar to the first, but it is used to connect on a personal level with the other side/party by showing that you empathize with them or share the same opinion/feeling, e.g. 'I can appreciate how you feel, being away on business when you have a young family is difficult'.

  <p><strong>What I'd like you to consider:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a phrase used by sellers. In this context it is used to introduce a description of the qualities and benefits that a product or service has. Good negotiators often focus here on the qualities and benefits which the company who will potentially buy regard/see as very important. In addition, they'll also focus on those qualities and benefits of their product or services which their competitors can't compete with them on, e.g. 'What I'd like you consider is the microprocessor this computer has. It's the fastest on the market and we're the only company of the market to use it'.  It's also used as a subtle way of criticizing the products or services of the competition.

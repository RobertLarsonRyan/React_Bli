<p class="openParaArticle">In this first part of three online exercises on police investigations and actions you will learn through reading a dialogue what happens at the beginning of a police investigation into a crime and what the police can do at this stage. In addition, you will learn some key vocabulary for this stage of an investigation (some of which you will already know, while others you probably won't).</p> 

<p>The vocabulary/terms and the processes explained here is for the English and Welsh legal system. Although there are some differences in both to other legal systems, mostly they are similar (if not the same) to other legal systems.</p>  

<p>At the end of the dialogue there is a quiz to ensure you correctly understand the different terms/vocabulary. In addition, once you have successfully completed the quiz, a "learn more" box will appear where you can find out more details about each term.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: The beginning of an investigation</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation between two friends, Marie and Emma, who are talking about what happens when police stop someone and what happens at the beginning of a police investigation into a crime.</p> 
 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>

 
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Hi Emma. Sorry I'm late. I was stopped by the police on my way here.'
      </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Why?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They said something about a crime happening. What it was, I can't remember. They asked me some questions about who I was and what I was doing, and then let me go. I get really nervous around the police. It's probably because English isn't my first language and I don't know much about the law and what my rights are either.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It is important to know about the law and what the police can and can't do. I studied law at university, so I can clear some things up about that for you.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That would be very helpful.'
      </span></p>      
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'First of all, here in England, if the police stop you and ask you questions, legally you don't have to answer them.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I didn't know that.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'However, if they suspect that you have committed a crime and are carrying something connected to a crime, they are legally able to stop and search you and then you have to do what they say. But they have to tell you before who they are and why they have stopped you and that they are going to search you.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Can they do that to anyone?'
      </span></p> 
  
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they can't. They have to have <strong>reasonable grounds</strong> for doing it. Like you match a description of someone who has committed a crime or you are behaving in a suspicious way.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So what you are saying is, they would do that if they think I am a potential <strong>suspect</strong> in a crime, that I have done or are doing something criminal.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Basically, yes.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what would happen if I refused to let them search me?'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They would very probably arrest you and then search you.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And if I tried to run away before they did that.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They would definitely arrest you then and then <strong>restrain</strong> you, so you couldn't run away again and then search you.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Restrain me with handcuffs, like in the movies?'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If you were being physically aggressive or trying to escape, then probably they would. But if you weren't, then they shouldn't. The police can't do whatever they want, they have rules and regulations to follow. So they can't use excessive force to detain somebody, like kicking someone in the head when arresting someone, they have to use <strong>reasonable force</strong> when physically stopping or touching someone.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And that depends on the situation they are in, I suppose.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Exactly. Going back to what happened to you, someone probably had <strong>reported a crime</strong> in the area and you probably fit the description of the suspect.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Someone told them that a crime had happened?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes. Probably the <strong>victim</strong> of the crime called the police to tell them what had happened to them.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And is reporting a crime the same thing as making an allegation?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In both you are making the police aware that some criminal offence has taken or is taking place. But with an <strong>allegation</strong>, you have to actually specify who has committed the crime, give their name. Whereas with reporting a crime, although you can make an allegation about who has done it, sometimes you can't, because you don't know who has done the crime or know the people you saw doing it.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, after the police are made aware that a crime has happened after someone has reported it or through an allegation, what do they do next?'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They will carry out an <strong>initial investigation</strong> to find out what has happened and to decide whether or not to proceed with the investigation.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What do they do to decide whether they are going to continue with it or not.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They firstly need to check out whether a crime has happened or not. So a police officer will go and speak with the victim of the crime and or the person who reported it. They will also try to find anyone who is a <strong>witness</strong> to the crime and speak with them to describe what they saw so to be clearer about what happened and to help them identify the person or people who did it. They will probably get them to write a <strong>statement</strong>, detailing everything that happened or what they saw. And they will use those signed statements as evidence in the investigation.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But isn't evidence things like a gun used in a shooting or an item of clothing or fingerprints found at a <strong>crime scene</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Physical objects like those which are found at where a crime happened are types of evidence, but <strong>evidence</strong> can also be what people said happened which has been recorded in a statement or noted down by the police.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And if they have a suspect for the crime, they will also speak with them. And the suspect can make a statement as well.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It seems logical.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So after they have got all this information and evidence, the police will then decide whether to continue the investigation or not.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Marie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what happens if they decide to continue with it?'
      </span></p>

Although they can talk to anyone they want to and ask them questions, the person being asked them, isn't under any legal obligation to answer them or even stop. In order to make a person stop and carry out certain activities, like searching/frisking them, the police officer needs to have justifiable "reasonable grounds" to believe that the person may have engaged, is engaging or will soon engage in a criminal activity. These "reasonable grounds" are based on a combination of different factors (like information they have received, the behaviour of the person and things they have observed) which any reasonable person would believe justified the actions. A police officer will have to be able to justify their actions both at the time and afterwards. If they can't, their actions could be deemed unlawful.</p>

  <p><strong>Reasonable force:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> When the police are arresting, stopping a crime or in self-defence or in defence of another person are legally able to touch or use physical force on another person. However, the force they use has to be reasonable given the situation they face. They can only use force if it is necessary (e.g. to arrest a person who is being physically aggressive or is a threat to others) and proportionate (they can't handcuff a suspect who is complying with their instructions when being arrested or hit someone who is only being verbally aggressive with them, for example). If a police officer uses force which isn't reasonable or proportionate given the circumstances, they are using "excessive force" which can have an impact both on the police officer and the criminal case against the suspect.</p>

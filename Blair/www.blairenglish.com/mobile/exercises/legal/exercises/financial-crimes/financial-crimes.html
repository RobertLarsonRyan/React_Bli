<p class="openParaArticle">When people think about criminality they normally imagine a certain type of person (someone violent or poor) or a certain environment in which it happens (e.g. an urban ghetto)  However, crime happens everywhere in society and many crimes are carried out in both places and by people which wouldn't commonly be associated with criminality. Financial crimes are one such example. These types of crimes are often called "white collar crimes", because they are often committed by professionals (e.g. accountants, business owners, stock brokers etc.') and done more out of greed than need.</p> 

<p>In this online exercise you will learn, understand and remember the names of different types of financial crimes. These are the names of the crimes in the "common law" legal system, the system of law which is used in the majority of English-speaking countries.  </p>  

<p>Do the quiz at the end of the exercise to both ensure you correctly understand the different criminal offences and to help you to remember them in the future.</p>



<p>To learn the names of crimes which are against property or involve other types of theft, do our <a href="../crimes-against-property/crimes-against-property.html"><strong>online exercise on the types of crimes against property or theft</strong></a>.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Financial crimes</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation between two friends, Peter and Juan, who are talking about different types of financial crimes.</p> 
 
<p>The words in <strong>bold</strong> are the names of different types of criminal offences. Remember them because at the end of the text there is a quiz to check your understanding.</p>

 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Have you heard that John Green in the finance department has been arrested?'
      </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, I haven't. What has he been arrested for?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Apparently, he's been stealing money for the company for at least a couple of years. He stole over 500,000.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So he's been charged with theft?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, because of his role he had permission to access the company's money which he stole. If he hadn't, it would be theft. But because he had legal permission to access it, it is called the crime of <strong>embezzlement</strong>.'
      </span></p>      
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How could he get away with it for so long? Surely, someone must have noticed the missing money?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'From what I hear he was altering financial statements which he was responsible for creating to make it look like the money he took had been spent elsewhere. So nobody noticed it missing for a while. So in addition to the charge of embezzlement, he will also be charged with committing <strong>fraud</strong> for the falsification and lying which he did on the financial statements.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I suppose when you embezzle so much money, you have to lie and hide information so as not to get caught.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Since he was caught the company have been doing their own investigation on him and they found out that he never studied at Oxford university as he always claimed he did.'
      </span></p> 
  
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But he had a certificate of his degree from there with his name on it hanging on the wall in his office. I remember talking to him about once when I was in his office.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, it must be a <strong>forgery</strong>, because he never studied there.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It goes to show, you should never trust people. Going back to what fraud is. I am right in thinking it is the act of lying or deceiving someone for your own financial benefit.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Pretty much. And the act is to the detriment of the people being lied to or deceived.'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, if a person doesn't declare all their income to the tax authorities and as a consequence, pay less tax to the government than they should, that is a type of fraud?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In theory yes. But the crime of doing that and paying less money in tax than you are legally obliged to is called <strong>tax evasion</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So I suppose criminal organisations are generally guilty of committing tax evasion, as they can't tell the tax authorities about the money they have obtained from their illegal activities.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they can't. Because it is not only a criminal offence to commit a crime (like selling illegal drugs), it is also a criminal offence to have money which comes/proceeds from these criminal activities. So they try to make the money that they get from their illegal activities appear to come from legal and legitimate sources. Like their money comes from a legal and legitimate business.'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And is it a crime to do that?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, it is. It is a crime called <strong>money laundering</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But it is not only criminal organisations who have to launder money, is it?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, anybody who obtains money through an illegal way may have to do it. Like for example a businessman giving a local politician a large amount of money to ensure they win a contract for their business. They are doing something illegal, so they need to clean it in some way.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what would that crime be?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Giving a gift or money to a person in a position of authority or power in order to make them do something for you, is called the criminal offence of <strong>bribery</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But isn't that called corruption?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It is a form of corruption. But with bribery both the person giving and the person receiving it can be charged with the offence. With the crime of <strong>corruption</strong> it is only about a person in a position of authority or power and them illegally or unethically using their position for personal gain. So receiving a bribe, forcing somebody to do something or giving friends and family members business contracts which they don't deserve are examples of corruption.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Corruption is basically the abuse of power.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A perfect description.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And can I ask a question about two other financial crimes which I don't understand the difference between?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Sure, go ahead.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'On the stock market I hear that people are charged with either insider trading or securities fraud. What is the difference between the two?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If you have access to information which is non-public and then you use that information to buy or sell stock and shares and for your financial benefit, then it is called <strong>insider trading</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That makes sense.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Whereas if you spread or tell false information about a company in order to get other investors to buy or sell stock in that company for your own personal benefit, then it is called <strong>securities fraud</strong>. You see the difference?'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The difference between the two is very clear.'
      </span></p>

"Money laundering" is the criminal offence which involves knowingly converting these proceeds of crime (which is a crime in itself) into financial assets which appear to have a legitimate origin and then can be used. There are numerous methods which are used to launder money derived from illegal activities. An example of money laundering is the setting up of legitimate businesses where this money is then put through as cash sales (which in fact never occurred). The money from profit which these businesses make appears from a legitimate source and then can be used.</p>

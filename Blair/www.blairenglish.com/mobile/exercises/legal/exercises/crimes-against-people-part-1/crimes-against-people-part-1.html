<p class="openParaArticle">Although the law can be very confusing, you would have thought that the one area in which it isn't, is in what makes specific actions (like threatening someone or hitting someone) particular crimes. However, this is not always the case. And people who haven't studied the law are often surprised what does and doesn't constitute a specific criminal offence, like battery for example.</p>

<p>In this first part of two online exercises on criminal offences against people (which are often violent) you will learn, understand and remember the names of crimes where the result is injury or damage (physical, emotional or psychological) to people. These are the names of the crimes in the "common law" legal system, the system of law which is used in the majority of English-speaking countries.</p>

<p>Do the quiz at the end of the exercise to both ensure you correctly understand the different criminal offences and to help you to remember them in the future.</p>

<p>However, before you start, you need to be aware that although the names of most criminal offences are the same or very similar in all countries which have a legal system based on common law, some crimes do have different names in different countries (or even states in America). For example, "aggravated burglary" in the English legal system is generally called "home invasion" in the American legal system. Where a criminal offence has different names to that in the exercise, this name (or names) will be given in the "learn more" section for each question in the exercise quiz at the end of the web page.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you also do <a href="../crimes-against-people-part-2/crimes-against-people-part-2.html"><strong>the second part of this exercise</strong></a>, to learn more crimes which are violent or against people.</p>

<h2>Exercise: Crimes against people</h2>
  <p>Read the following conversation between two friends, Peter and Juan, who are talking about crimes which are either violent or against people.</p> 
 
<p>The words in <strong>bold</strong> are the names of different types of criminal offences. Remember them because at the end of the text there is a quiz to check your understanding.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Morning Juan. You look very tired. Didn't you sleep well last night?'
      </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, I didn't.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Why?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There is a group of teenagers who often hang out in front of my house. Last night they were drunk and shouting until the early hours of the morning. So, I didn't sleep well.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You should have called the police because they were engaging in <strong>anti-social behaviour</strong>, which is a crime.'
      </span></p>      
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They weren't violent, they were just loud and drunk.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Engaging in a type of behaviour which is regarded as unacceptable in a public place, (like being very drunk) or which affects their neighbours (like playing very loud music), is the criminal offence of anti-social behaviour. It is not a serious crime, but it is a crime all the same.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So football hooliganism is an example of anti-social behaviour?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah, it can be. If in addition to being loud and drunk and damaging things, they are actually fighting or being very aggressive amongst themselves in a public place, then they are committing the crime of <strong>affray</strong>. Engaging in a behaviour which causes other people not involved to fear for their safety.'
      </span></p> 
  
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'With the kids outside my house, would it have been anti-social behaviour or affray if I had gone out to tell them to be quiet and they had threatened to hurt me?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It wouldn't be affray because they weren't fighting or acting aggressively amongst themselves. But by threatening to physically hurt you, they are committing another crime in addition to anti-social behaviour. That is the crime of <strong>assault</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But isn't assault when you physically attack someone? People say that someone assaulted them when they have been physically attacked.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, and it can and it is in some countries used with that meaning. But traditionally in legal English, it just means to be threatened without any physical contact. If someone does touch you; they punch, slap or push you in an aggressive way for example, the criminal offence is called <strong>battery</strong>.'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So sometimes assault means physically attacking someone and sometimes it just means threatening without physical contact. It is very confusing.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I know, that's the law for you. Never simple!'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'One of my friends actually got badly beaten up by a group of five men last year for no reason. They kicked him in the head several times. He was in hospital for a week because of his injuries. So the people who had done it, would have been charged with the crime of battery then?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Actually no. The crime of battery is normally used against a person where the victim receives minor injuries, like bruises for example, but nothing serious. If your friend was in the hospital for a week, I presume your friend suffered serious injuries. In that case, the people who did it would be charged with the more serious crime of <strong>aggravated assault and battery</strong>.'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'He did suffer serious injuries. At one point the doctors thought that he may die, but fortunately he didn't.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If he had died, the people who attacked him could have been charged with murder.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But isn't the crime of murder only when someone plans before to kill someone and then does it?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The unlawful killing of someone doesn't only have to be planned for it to be considered as the crime of <strong>murder</strong>. You can also commit the crime of murder if you kill somebody without planning to do it, but you do something violent to them which any reasonable person should know could very likely kill them. You said that they kicked him in the head several times. Everyone knows that that could kill someone.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So what crime would it be if I got into a fight after having an argument with a stranger in the street and as a result of the fight, he dies of his injuries. Would that be regarded as murder as well?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In that situation you would have committed the crime of voluntary manslaughter.  There wasn't any planning to kill, but you were doing something which was violent against him (i.e. the fighting) which could potentially cause their death or serious injury.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But that is the same as murder, isn't it?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, but in the situation you gave me, there was some provocation, i.e. the argument which caused the fight. And because of that provocation, if he died you would probably be charged with <strong>voluntary manslaughter</strong> instead of murder. But with your friend, the group of men attacked him for no other reason than to physically  hurt him. You see the difference?'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah, I think. Is voluntary manslaughter what some people call a crime of passion?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah. People are often charged with voluntary manslaughter when they become violent and lose control because of something happening and then kill somebody. It is less severely punished than murder.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And would it be voluntary manslaughter if I killed someone whilst I was drunk driving?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, it wouldn't. Mainly because you are not doing something which is intentionally violent towards someone or you want to hurt them. Their death has resulted from you doing something which you know you shouldn't do (e.g. driving when drunk) or not doing something you know you should (e.g. forgetting to cover a deep hole in the ground which someone subsequently falls down into and dies from). This type of homicide is called <strong>involuntary manslaughter</strong>, you kill somebody as a result of doing something badly.'

But even if there isn't any planning/premeditation to kill someone, it can still be regarded as "murder" instead of "manslaughter" if a person does an action which they should know will (or is very likely to) kill somebody.

The damage done to the victim is more serious than simple "assault and battery" and as a result is more severely punished by the courts.</p>

  <p><strong>Voluntary manslaughter:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A type of homicide where a person kills another person unlawfully without any planning/premedition. However, for the act to be judged to be "voluntary manslaughter" rather than "murder" (which doesn't always have to be planned or premeditated), there has to be some form of reasonable provocation or emotion involved when doing it. For example, when a man kills his intimate partner while having a violent argument or when a person kills somebody when in a fight in a bar.<br><br> Because "reasonable provocation" is a vague concept, if the death happens in such situations the prosecution may still try to get the person convicted of "murder" instead of "voluntary manslaughter", which is a more serious crime and punished more by the courts.</p>

This could be punching someone, slapping someone, scratching someone or pushing/pulling someone. Where there is more serious harm/injuries to the victim, the perpetrator would be charged with a different crime, e.g. "aggravated assault and battery".</p>

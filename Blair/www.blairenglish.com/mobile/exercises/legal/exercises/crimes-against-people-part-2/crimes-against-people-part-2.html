<p class="openParaArticle">In this second part of two online exercises on criminal offences you will learn, understand and remember the names of more crimes where the result is injury or damage (physical, emotional or psychological) to people. These are the names of the crimes in the "common law" legal system, the system of law which is used in the majority of English-speaking countries.</p>

<p>Do the quiz at the end of the exercise to both ensure you correctly understand the different criminal offences and to help you to remember them in the future.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you also do <a href="../crimes-against-people-part-1/crimes-against-people-part-1.html"><strong>the first part of this exercise</strong></a>, it will give you a thorough understanding of the topic. It really doesn't matter which part you do first. But I would recommend doing both parts.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Crimes against people</h2>
 
  <p>Read the following conversation between two friends, Peter and Juan, who are continuing to talk about crimes which are either violent or against people.</p> 
 
<p>The words in <strong>bold</strong> are the names of different types of criminal offences. Remember them because at the end of the text there is a quiz to check your understanding.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, if I was threatened and then physically attacked by a stranger or a friend, then that person could be charged with assault and battery, and if the injuries were more serious, it would be aggravated assault and battery?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, they would be.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Would it be the same if the person was a member of my family or an ex-partner?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Even though the crimes are basically the same (i.e. you are attacked), the crime is called <strong>domestic violence</strong> or aggravated domestic violence if the perpetrator, the person doing it, is or was a member of your family. And the courts will often punish the person who did it more severely.'
      </span></p>      
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That makes sense. I have a question. What does <strong>aggravated</strong> mean? It seems to make crimes more serious and you are punished more if you are convicted.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Basically, it does. With aggravated assault and battery for example, it means the injuries were a lot more severe than with simple assault and battery.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what about aggravated burglary?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In addition, aggravated is also often added to some crimes which are not necessarily violent. So if it is added to burglary or sexual assault, it means that violence or the threat of violence (maybe with a weapon) were also used when the crime was being committed. And you will be punished more if convicted of the crime.'
      </span></p> 
  
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When you say sexual assault, you mean when somebody rapes someone?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they are different. Rape is a more serious crime than sexual assault.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But in both a person forces somebody to have sexual intercourse with them against their will or without consent.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Actually, no. <strong>Rape</strong> is what you just described, where there is penetration of the penis in the other person's mouth, vagina or anus. Whereas with <strong>sexual assault</strong>, there is physical contact but no penetration. The person is touched in or is made to touch certain areas of the body (e.g. a woman's breasts) against their will or without consent by another person for sexual gratification.'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And would it be sexual assault if a person made repeated sexual comments about another person?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, it wouldn't. If someone makes repeated socially inappropriate comments (e.g. sexual, racial, critical etc...) to or about another person or repeatedly makes any type of threatening comments to or about them which harms a person emotionally or psychologically, it is a criminal offence called <strong>harassment</strong>.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what is the crime called when you take somebody somewhere against their will or without their consent, like stealing a person.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It depends on the reason why you are taking them.'
      </span></p> 
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I don't understand what you mean.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, if you take somebody to somewhere against their will or without their consent and then hold them there to force another person to do something for you (like pay you money or to do an action) then the criminal offence is called <strong>kidnapping</strong>. Whereas if you do basically the same, but you are not doing it to force another person to do something for you, then that would be called <strong>abduction</strong>, which is a less serious crime.'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So if I took an ex-partner against her will to my house and stopped her from leaving because I was jealous and angry, that would be abduction, wouldn't it?'
      </span></p>
      
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, it would. And you would also probably be charged with the crime of false imprisonment for stopping her from leaving your house as well.'
      </span></p>

In the case of "aggravated burglary", it means that the perpetrator not only burgled the property, but also used or threatened violence whilst doing it. With "aggravated robbery", it means whilst in the act of committing a robbery there is the use of violence or the threat of imminent violence (generally with a deadly weapon) to people. Adding "aggravated" to a crime, suggests the crime was more harmful to the victim(s). As a result, it is more severely punished.</p>

  <p><strong>Domestic violence:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> It is also known as "domestic assault and battery" or occasionally "intimate partner violence". It is when someone in a domestic setting (a partner, ex-partner, child or other family member) is physically harmed or where there is the threat of violence and there is emotional and psychological damage as a result. The people don't have to live together for it to be the crime of "domestic violence", but are in or have had a family like or romantic relationship. Although it is basically the same as "assault and battery", the crime of domestic violence is more severely punished in the courts. And the punishment given by the courts is increased if someone is convicted of the crime more than once.<br><br>
Legally, "domestic violence" is different from "domestic abuse". Although violence or the threat of violence does form a part of "domestic abuse", it also covers a lot of other recurring abusive behaviours (emotional, financial, religious, reproductive, financial or sexual) which are used by one person to gain or maintain power and control over another, some of which are not crimes in themselves. In many places "domestic abuse" is not actually a crime, whereas "domestic violence" is. However, some of the things which are involved in "domestic abuse" actually are (like false imprisonment, where an adult is forced to stay in a place against their will). So the person would be charged with these instead of "domestic abuse".</p>

If there isn't a financial motive for taking and holding the person (to get a ransom for example) or they are not being used to make somebody do something (to not testify in court for example), then it would be regarded as "abduction". If there was, it would be regarded as "kidnapping".</p>

<p class="openParaArticle">Criticising people for making mistakes is not easy. Some people hate doing it because it can cause arguments. But, if you don't want people to continue making the same mistakes or cause damage, it is essential that you do it.</p> 

<p>The most important thing to do when you have to criticize somebody's work or behaviour is prepare and plan before what you are going to say. How you criticize somebody who has done something serious or very bad is different to how you do it for somebody who has made a small mistake. For serious mistakes, it should be direct and formal, but not aggressive. For small or less serious mistakes, it should be more like advice and less criticism. But for both you always need to have examples or evidence of the mistake/problem.</p> 

<p>In this online exercise on criticizing people, you will learn and remember English phrases that you can use when criticizing work colleagues for their work or behaviour in both formal and informal situations. In this exercise, you will also see phrases that are used when somebody accepts the criticism and when somebody does not accept the criticism.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Criticizing colleagues at work</h2>
 
 <p>In the following two situations, one person is criticising another. In the first, Emma is criticizing John on some mistakes he has made on a report he wrote. In the second, Jonathan is criticizing Vicky because of her behaviour with a customer.</p> 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <h3>Situation 1</h3>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'John, <strong>can I have a quick word</strong>?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I've just read your report about the current progress with the new supermarket project. <strong>Overall, it's good. But there are a few things that could be improved</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'OK.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I can't seem to find the projected future costs of the project on the report.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, I can explain what happened. We still haven't finished them yet. I'm really sorry. I'll make sure they are completed and they'll be in the report by the end of the day.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Thank you. I've looked at how you've explained things on the report. And for me, it doesn't seem very clear what you are trying to say. <strong>How do you think it could be improved</strong>?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It seems fine to me.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Don't take this the wrong way, but</strong> it needs to be re-written. It's not very easy to read. There are quite a few grammatical errors and some parts of the text are confusing to understand.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Really! I don't know what else I could have done. It makes perfect sense to me.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Just have a look at</strong> this paragraph.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You have a point.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's just that the report is going to the client, so everything needs to be perfect. I understand that you're busy and it's easy to forget that the people who'll read the report have less technical knowledge than yourself. <strong>I've done the same myself</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Sorry, what would you like me to do?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Add the projected future costs to the report and then I'll re-write the report. <strong>Just be more careful in the future</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'OK.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Emma:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Don't worry. But <strong>if you're unsure in the future, just ask me</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 

 
 
 
 <br>
 <h3>Situation 2</h3>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Would you mind coming to my office for a minute?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'OK.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Take a seat. The reason I've asked you to come here is that <strong>we have received a complaint about you</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Really! Who from?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'From a customer. <strong>Can you think why that is</strong>?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I've no idea.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A woman said that you wouldn't help her with her enquiry and that you also insulted her.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I spoke to a woman this morning who was very aggressive to me, but I didn't insult her. She wanted us to go to her house to repair today and I told her it was impossible. I told her that the earliest someone could go was on Friday.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I appreciate that, but</strong> this isn't the first time that you have received a complaint from a customer.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That was different. Today, I did everything correctly.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, <strong>how do you account for</strong> the complaint?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I don't know. But I did everything that I should.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I am afraid I have to disagree</strong>. I have listened to a recording of the call and you were aggressive with her.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'She continued demanding that we had to go and repair her TV today. She wouldn't shut up. I did nothing wrong.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, if that's your attitude, <strong>you leave me no alternative but to</strong> give you a verbal warning about your behaviour.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Vicky:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's not fair! It was her fault, not mine!'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Jonathan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>If it happens again, we'll have to</strong> give you a written warning. You do understand what this could mean?'
 </span></p>

<FORM>
<p>1. A polite but direct phrase where you say that you do not agree with what somebody has said, is <br>

  <p><strong>I am afraid I have to disagree:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is basically a formal and polite way of telling somebody 'I'm sorry, but what you've just told me is wrong'. It is used after the person being criticised has given a reason why the mistake/thing done badly happened (e.g. 'it's not my responsibility to check the report') or what their opinion is about what you have just told them (e.g. 'I think the report is fine, it doesn't need to be changed'). The phrase should be followed by explanation of why you disagree, e.g. 'I am afraid I have to disagree. The report is too short and doesn't include anything about last month's sales'. In Spanish: <em><b>"me temo que tengo que discrepar"</b></em>.</p>

<option value="how do you account for">how do you account for</option>

  <p><strong>How do you think it could be improved:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is neutral (it can be used in both formal/informal situations). In some situations when you have to tell somebody that their work or behaviour isn't good, it is more productive/better to get the other person to identify the mistake(s)/problem(s) themselves, rather than directly tell them what they didn't do well (e.g. 'the graph doesn't look very good' or 'you should speak louder when giving the presentation'). You can use 'how do you think it could be improved?' to do this. If after this, they don't identify the problem, then you should either tell or show them where the mistakes are. In this situation, you should be polite and use verbs like 'I feel/think' or 'just have a look' to do this (e.g. 'I think that the graph could be better'). In Spanish: <em><b>"cómo piensas que puede mejorarse"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>We have received a complaint about you:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a formal and direct phrase that is used to tell a person that somebody (it can be a work colleague or a customer) has made a complaint about them. This is mostly used when you have to criticise somebody's behaviour or conduct (e.g. being late, insulting somebody etc...) and the problem/mistake is serious. In these situations, this phrase should be one of the first things you say.  It is normal to let the person respond/answer after saying it, e.g. 'we have received a complaint about you' 'really, about what?'. Then you can either tell them what the complaint is or ask them what they think the complaint is, e.g. 'can you think why that is?'.

This phrase should only be used for serious issues (e.g. insulting a customer/work colleague, not doing something important they should have etc...) or when they have done the same mistake a lot of times. After the phrase you should say what the consequences will be (e.g. 'give you a written warning', 'remove you from the project' etc...). For example, 'If it happens again, we'll have to remove you from the project'. In Spanish: <em><b>"si la situación se vuelve a repetir, tendremos que"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Just be more careful in the future:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is informal and should be used for small mistakes/problems. It is a very good phrase to use in these situations, because although it is basically a warning (like saying 'don't do it again'), it sounds more like you are giving the person you are criticizing advice. When using with phrase, it is important to say it slowly in a kind way or caring way. If you say it quickly, it can sound like an order. It should be used at the end of the conversation.

This phrase should always be followed by a reason or an opinion of why you don't agree with what they have said (e.g. 'that doesn't justify insulting her' 'you have to write the report' etc...).

It's a politer and less aggressive way of saying 'this is wrong' or 'this doesn't make sense'. Rather than directly criticising something they have done (which makes some people angry or depressed), you let the other person find their own mistake, which seems like you're helping rather than criticising. This phrase is used after you have told them there are some mistakes. The phrase is followed by telling them where the mistake(s) is in the text, e.g. 'this part', 'the bottom'.

<p><strong>Can I have a quick word:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is an informal and common way to say 'can I speak to you'. It is not only used for when you are going to criticise somebody, but also when you want to speak or tell somebody something in private. Another phrase that has a similar meaning but is formal and is only used when you're going to criticise somebody for something serious or give somebody some bad news is 'would you mind coming into my office for few moments'. In Spanish: <em><b>"puedo hablar contigo un momento"</b></em>.</p>

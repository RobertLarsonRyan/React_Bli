 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation, two friends (Simon and John) are talking about the different relationships that the companies they work for have with other companies.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You work for a company that makes televisions, don't you John?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. The fifth largest television manufacturer in the world.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Does your company manufacture all the parts it uses to make a television itself? You know, the electronic components and the screens etc...'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The company used to make all the different parts it uses to make a television in the past. But now, apart from manufacturing the screens and the plastic cases, we purchase all the electronic components used in them from <strong>suppliers</strong>, other companies which manufacture or produce them.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But why does your company buy the components from suppliers?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's basically cheaper than manufacturing them ourselves. So we have <strong>contracts</strong> with these companies, Legal agreement with them to supply us with parts we need to make our TVs.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, apart from the electronic components, your company does everything else itself? It assembles all the TVs itself?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah, unlike many other companies we assemble/put the TVs together <strong>in-house</strong>. We do it within the company, in our own factories, with our own employees/staff.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And other TV manufacturers don't assemble their televisions themselves? I can see why they would pay third-party companies to do things that they don't specialize in. But I would have thought that assembling TVs is something they would want to do themselves!'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Most don't. They normally <strong>outsource</strong> the assembly to other companies to do. It sounds strange, but it's cheaper for them to pay another company to do it.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Where I work, they have outsourced some of the important <strong>operations</strong> as well. Human resources and accounting for the company is now done by an external company.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I know you work in a web design company. What do you do if you suddenly need more staff to work on a project?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We don't outsource it to another company. Normally, we temporarily contract people or a small company to help us finish it. These <strong>external contractors</strong> work with us for a couple of weeks or months until the project is done.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How do you find the external contractors to hire?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A lot of the times, it's people or small companies we know or have worked for us before. But sometimes we use <strong>intermediaries</strong> to find them. A company who specialise in finding external contractors with the right skills and experience for companies.'
</span></p>


 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We sometimes use intermediaries at my company when we urgently need some parts or materials. It's easier and quicker for them to put us in contact with the suppliers who have them available than it is for us to do it ourselves. But they do charge a lot for the service they provide.<br><br>

And if you have a large project, do you hire external contractors to help you do it?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We often hire them. The problem with the web design industry is that sometimes you have a lot of work and other times you have little. So to help us when we are busy, we have a <strong>verbal agreement</strong> with a couple of other web design companies that we can use some of their staff if they don't need them.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So you have a contract with them?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, it's not a contract. It's like a promise. We'll help them if we can and they'll help us if they can.<br><br>

But on very large projects, we normally have to work together with another company to do it. So, it's a project for both companies. We often do these <strong>joint ventures</strong> when we are doing a large project in a country we are not based in or we don't have the expertise to do all the project ourselves. So, it's better to partner with a company who does.<br><br>

Does your company sell its TVs directly to customers?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, we don't. We normally sell our products directly to <strong>retailers</strong>, like electronic stores, supermarkets etc... They order them directly from us. They then sell our televisions to customers.<br><br> 

Does your wife still work for McDonald's?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'She doesn't work for McDonald's, she owns a McDonald's restaurant.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How can she own a McDonald's restaurant?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'She owns a <strong>franchise</strong> of McDonald's. McDonald's like many other restaurant companies (and some retail chains) don't own most of the places which use their name and sell their products. Instead other people or companies both own and run them.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">John:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So how does McDonald's make any money?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Simon:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The people who own the restaurants both have to pay McDonald's to use their brand name and purchase all the products they sell directly from McDonald's.'

  <p><strong>Joint ventures:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em>  A 'joint venture' is when two or more separate companies work together in partnership on something. This can be on a single project or product (e.g. building the Channel Tunnel between England and France), or they set up a separate company (e.g. Sony Ericsson before Sony took control of the company).<br><br>

There are two main reasons why 'joint ventures' between companies happen. The first is because a project is too large or too risky for one company to do it by itself (e.g. the Channel Tunnel). The other reason is government intervention. Some countries (China in particular) require a foreign company to set up a 'joint venture' with a company from their country if they want to produce or sell their product in the country. A example of such a 'joint venture' in China is BMW Brilliance.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"operaciones/empresas conjuntas"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>External contractors:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> Also called 'independent contractors', 'contractors' or sometimes 'freelancers' (but only for individuals). These are individuals or employees from another business who temporarily work in a company (within a department, team or on a project) but are not employees of that company. They are contracted, not employed by the company.<br><br>

Normally, companies hire 'external contractors' when they need extra staff for a short period of time (e.g. 2 months). This could be because they are busy or they need somebody who has certain skills or expertise for one particular piece of work or project they are doing.<br><br> 

Although 'external contractors' are normally paid more per hour than employees of a company (and sometimes a lot more), there are many advantage to companies of hiring them. For example, they can be quickly hired, companies don't have to pay taxes for them, they don't have to train them and once their contract is over they are gone.<br><br>

Using 'external contractors' is different to 'outsourcing'. With 'external contractors', they work within the company on something. With 'outsourcing', an operation or process is done outside of a company by another business.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"contratistas externos"</b></em>.</p>

The opposite of 'in-house' is 'outsourced'. When a company 'outsources' an operation/activity, they pay another company to do it for them.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"en la empresa/interno"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Outsource:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to outsource'. This is when a particular activity/function which is normally done in a company (e.g. accounting and finance, marketing, customer services, manufacturing etc...), is given to an external company to perform/do. This external company is paid to do this business operation.<br><br>

The main reason why companies 'outsource' some of their operations, is because it is cheaper. The external company who is doing the 'outsourced' operation may specialise in doing it or operate in a country where the costs are lower (e.g. India and China).<br><br>

'outsourcing' (which is the noun) is different to using 'external contractors'. With 'external contractors', individuals or employees from a business work within the company on something. With 'outsourcing', an operation or process is removed and done outside of the company.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"externalizar"</b></em>.</p>

In business, 'contracts' are commonly used to reduce the risk that companies won't do things that they have promised to each other. To ensure that they do what they promise, there are normally consequences written into the 'contract' of not abiding/complying (e.g. a payment of money).<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"contratos"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Intermediaries:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> An 'intermediary' is a company or person that provides a service of connecting two parties (either people or companies) together. Their purpose is to enable some trade (either of goods or services) between the two. For this service, they charge a fee.<br><br>

Companies normally use 'intermediaries' to find some product or service that they need (e.g. new staff etc...) or get new customers for their own products or services. Although companies can do this themselves, they often don't have the connections or expertise in doing this that 'intermediaries' do. As result, it is normally quicker and easier to just use them.<br><br>

Some 'intermediaries' help both parties reach an agreement (e.g. on price), while others just connect the two and do nothing else.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"intermediarios"</b></em>.</p>

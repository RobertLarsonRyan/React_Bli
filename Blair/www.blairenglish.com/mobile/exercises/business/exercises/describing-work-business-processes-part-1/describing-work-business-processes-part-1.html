 <p class="openParaArticle">Sometimes you will have to describe the stages/steps which are performed/done to complete something that either your company or you do at work. Unfortunately, most of the times that you will have to describe these tasks/processes are in important situations (e.g. in a job interview, presentation, speaking to a potential or existing customer etc...).</p>

<p>So, it is important that you can not only explain this workflow in both a clear and understandable way, but that you also use professional sounding vocabulary to do it.</p>

<p>In this first of two online exercises on 'work/business processes', you will both learn and remember the professional English vocabulary used for talking about the different processes used to perform tasks in service industries (e.g. banking, insurance, travel etc...).</p>    

<p>After you have done this exercise, I would recommend that you do <a href="../../../../../exercises/business/exercises/describing-work-business-processes-part-2/describing-work-business-processes-part-2.html"><b><u>the second part of this exercise to learn further processes</u></b></a>.</p>

 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation between two friends where one (Peter) describes to the other (Juan) what the team he runs in a bank does.</p>
 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You work as a manager at a bank, don't you?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, I do. But I don't actually work in a branch like you find on the high/main street in any town or city. I work in the loans department in the bank's head office.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, what do you do?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Do you want me to tell you? It's not exciting.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, I do.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I am the manager of a team that <strong>is responsible for</strong> both processing loan requests from existing customers of the bank (people who already have a bank account with us) and deciding whether we should give them the money/loan.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How do you do that?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If somebody wants to borrow money from us to buy a house, a car etc..., they first have to <strong>submit</strong> a loan request to the bank. They do this by either completing an online form on the bank's website or by completing a paper form and sending it to the bank.
<br><br>
If the person completed a loan request form on paper, their form is then <strong>inputted</strong> on to the bank's loan application system by another of the teams in the office here. That team has to <strong>manually</strong> enter all the form's information by hand on to the system.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, how does your team get the loan requests?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'All the loan requests for the bank's existing customers are <strong>automatically</strong> sent to my team either directly from the website or from the loan application system when they have been inputted.
<br><br>
When we have received them, each request is then <strong>allocated</strong> to a different member of my team. From that point, that loan request is their responsibility to process.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How do you decide who to allocate/give each loan request to on your team?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It depends on how many loan requests each member of my team is dealing with at that time. If one of my team is working on less requests than others, they are automatically allocated the request.'
</span></p>



 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How long does it take them to process a loan request?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There is a 5 day <strong>turnaround time</strong> for each request to be processed. So we have to make a decision within 5 <strong>working days</strong> for each request we receive in our team.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When you say working days, that doesn't include Saturdays or Sundays does it?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. If we receive a loan request on Wednesday, we have to process the request and make a decision by the following Tuesday at the latest. 
<br><br>
But loans request which are for a large amount of money (e.g. over $40,000), are <strong>prioritized</strong>. These loan requests are very important and the bank makes a lot of money from them. So, these are not only allocated to the most experienced members of my team, but they also have to be done quicker. So they have a 3 working day turnaround time.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what happens if you don't process a loan request within the turnaround time?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'My team has to <strong>meet set targets</strong>. One of the set targets is to complete all loan requests within the turnaround time (i.e. 5 or 3 days). If we don't, then the team is  <strong>penalised</strong>.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So your team is punished for not completing a loan request in time?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah. Every late loan request we complete reduces the bonus (extra money) the team receives at the end of the year.'
</span></p>

  <p><strong>Working days:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'working days' means the days of the week which most companies operate on. In most countries, this is Monday to Friday. These five days are called 'working days'.<br><br> 
When companies deal with customer requests, orders or enquiries, they normally inform them of the amount of time it will take to process them. If a customer makes an order with a company on a Tuesday and they are told that it will take 7 'working days' to be delivered. They will expect to receive their order not on the following Tuesday, but on the following Thursday (because Saturdays and Sundays are not 'working days').<br><br>
In addition, if there is a bank/public holiday where most companies are closed (e.g. Christmas Day or Easter Monday), this day is also not considered a 'working day'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"días laborables

When talking about business processes, this like many other verbs is often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be punished'). For example, 'any staff who are late to work are penalised with a hour reduction in their monthly salary'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"penalizar"</b></em>.</p>

It means the amount of time that it takes a process to be completed (i.e. from when it was received to when it was completed). For example, 'the turnaround time for the customer order was 3 days'.<br><br>
Most companies have fixed/set 'turnaround times' for certain processes they do (like a time limit). This means that the process has to be completed within this set time. This is common with customer orders, enquiries, repairs etc...<br><br>
For example, 'The turnaround time for answering customer enquiries is 24 hours. Customers have to be provided with an answer within this time.'<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"el tiempo necesario/requerido hacer algo"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Manually:</strong><br><em>(adverb)</em> When something has to be done by hand (whether it is inputting data on to an application with a keyboard or making/doing something with your hands), it is called a 'manual' task/process.<br><br>
When talking about business processes, verbs are often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be created'). So if you want to say that a process is 'manual', you would use the adverb 'manually'. For example, 'the reports are manually created by me'.<br><br>
The opposite of 'manually' is 'automatically'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"manualmente"</b></em>.</p>

<div id="n5">
<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n5')"> 
<tr> 
<td> 
  <p><strong>Is responsible for:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> You use this when you want to tell somebody about the main thing(s) you do (your main responsibilities) at work. You should always tell people what the main purpose(s) is of either your job or your team/department before explaining the individual processes/tasks that are used to achieve it. If you don't, people listening to you will probably get confused.<br><br>
The purpose(s) are always said after this phrase and as a gerund (e.g. contacting, organising etc...). For example, 'I'm responsible for generating reports for the company'.<br><br>
You shouldn't use 'to be responsible for' when describing what a company/business does. You should use a verb instead (e.g. sells, buys, advises, makes etc...). For example, 'my company sells insurance'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"es responsable de/por"</b></em>.</p>

<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n6')"> 
<tr> 
<td>  
  <p><strong>Allocated:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to allocate'. It's basically a more professional sounding way to say 'give' or 'assign' somebody a task/piece of work to complete. You would use 'allocate' when you want to say both that work is distributed to different people in a team to do and how it is done. For example, 'every call received in the call centre is randomly allocated to a different member of staff'.<br><br>

When talking about business processes, this like many other verbs is often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be allocated'). In addition, 'allocate' is followed by 'to' and the name of the type of people they are given to. For example, 'all enquiries are allocated to a different customer service assistant to answer'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"asignar"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Automatically:</strong><br><em>(adverb)</em> When something doesn't have to be done by hand/manually, it is called a 'automated' task/process. Normally 'automated' tasks are done by machines (e.g. cutting pieces of wood or metal in a factory etc...) or by a computer (e.g. analysing data etc...).<br><br>
When talking about business processes, verbs are often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be created'). So if you want to say that a process is 'automated', you would use the adverb 'automatically'. For example, 'the reports are automatically created by the computer application'.<br><br>
The opposite of 'automatically' is 'manually'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"automáticamente"</b></em>.</p>

When talking about business processes, this like many other verbs is often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be inputted'). In addition, when you use 'input', it is followed by 'onto' and the name of system/application it is added to.

  <p><strong>Prioritized:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to prioritize'. Basically, it means to treat something as more important than something else. Companies do this because they know that somethings could or do have more impact (either positive or negative) on their business. For example, a computer problem only affecting 10 people in the company will have less impact on the business than another computer problem affecting 10,000 people.<br><br>
Normally, when tasks or pieces of work 'are prioritized' they are done more quickly and allocated to more senior or experienced staff to do.<br><br>
When talking about business processes, this like many other verbs is often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be prioritized'). For example, 'if the problem affects one of the directors in the company, it is prioritized and allocated to a senior member of the team to be fixed'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"priorizar"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Submit:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to submit'.

Normally, 'submit' is only used when people send some type of form or document (e.g. a CV/resume etc...). You don't use it when people send in just an email.<br><br> 
When talking about business processes, this like many other verbs is often used in the passive form (i.e. 'to be submitted'). For example, 'once an order is submitted on the website, an email is sent directly to the customer'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"presentar/enviar"</b></em>.</p>

<p class="openParaArticle">There are two things that are very common in the business world, problems and change. Things often don't work as they should and need to be fixed and new products and services are constantly being introduced.</p> 

<p>For both of these, it is necessary to express the probability of something being fixed or being ready. Although you can use simple phrases like 'perhaps', 'I'm sure' or verbs like 'it will be' or 'it might be' to express probability, there are also lots of other expressions/phrases that you can use and hear.</p>

<p>In this online exercise you will learn commonly used phrases in English to express different levels of probability of something happening in the future. First, read the below dialogue/conversation and then do the quiz/test at the end to learn how to both use the vocabulary and say/pronounce it perfectly.</p> 

<p>Although the exercise is focused on business English, these phrases can also be in non-business situations as well.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Expressing Probability in a Meeting</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation in an internal business meeting in a customer service department about various items on the meeting's agenda.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 

 
 <p><span class="names">Chair:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, on to the third item on the agenda, the problems with the customer services telephone system. John from IT, do you have an update on this for us?'
   </span></p>
   
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes I do. We've been investigating this for the past couple of weeks and we believe that we've found the problem.'
   </span></p> 
   
 <p><span class="names">Customer Service Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You believe you've found it?'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>As far as I can see, yes</strong>.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Customer Service Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, it will be fixed soon?'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'We believe that we've identified the problem. Now we have to find a way of fixing it.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Customer Service Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Will it be fixed within a week?'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Telephone systems are highly complex, so <strong>it's highly unlikely</strong>.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Customer Service Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Within 2 weeks?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'm afraid to say this, but <strong>it's anyone's guess</strong>. We don't know how long it will take. It could be 2 weeks or 2 months.'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Customer Service Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I can't take this back to my manager, he'll want to know a date.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Based on similar problems we've had in the past, an <strong>educated guess</strong> would be about a month. But that's not certain. There's still a lot of work to do.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Chair:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Now, let's move on to item four on the agenda, the training programme for the new customer call system. What's the current situation?'
   </span></p>
   
       
 <p><span class="names">Trainer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's going as anticipated. We've nearly finished writing the course.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Chair:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, it will be ready for the beginning of March?'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Trainer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, <strong>without a shadow of a doubt</strong>, it will be ready for then.
   </span></p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Customer Service Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's very important it is ready for then. The training needs to be done before the new call system goes live on the second of April.'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Trainer:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>I give you my word</strong> it will be ready for the beginning of March.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Chair:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok, let's move on to the fifth item on the agenda. The opening of the new customer call centre in Dublin. Unfortunately, <strong>it's still up in the air</strong>. The city council is still refusing to give us the financial assistance that we need to open up the call centre there. So, <strong>it's doubtful</strong> that it'll be open by the end of the year. But we all know how councils change their minds, so <strong>we can't exclude the possibility that</strong> it will happen by then, even though it's not likely. So, we need the IT department to continue with their plans for integrating this call centre's computer and telephone systems into our IT network.'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">IT Manager:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But if they are refusing to give us financial assistance, then what is the point in continuing planning?'
   </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Chair:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I spoke to our Irish director last week and he told me that the reason that they have refused it is because the council's budget has been reduced. But he's spoken to several members of the council about it, who have told him that there is now a lot of support for giving us financial help. So, <strong>the indications are that</strong> we'll obtain the financial assistance, but he doesn't know whether we'll receive confirmation of this within a month or within six months.<br><br>
 
 Anyway, on to the last point on the agenda, the new government legislation. The government has not said if it will or will not happen. So, <strong>I wouldn't like to say</strong> if it will be introduced by June as it was originally intended to be. I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.'</span></p>

This phrase is normally used as an answer to somebody's question about the probability of something. You can also express a low probability with this phrase by replacing the 'yes' with a 'no', e.g. 'will the car be delivered by Friday?' 'as far as I can see, no'.

The person saying it, is in effect guaranteeing to the other person that it will happen.  But it does mean that if it doesn't happen then they'll personally take responsibility.  This phrase is normally used as an answer to somebody's question about the probability of something. It shouldn't be used if you have any doubt that something will happen.

  <p><strong>It's highly unlikely:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is very commonly used to say that there is a very low possibility that something will happen or that something is the reason or cause. By removing the 'highly', the phrase 'it's unlikely'   means that something is not probable. Both phrases are followed by 'that' if you want to confirm what the subject of the probability is, e.g. 'It's highly unlikely that he'll arrive here before midnight'. You can also use 'likely', which has the opposite meaning, i.e. 'something is probable'. For example, 'it's likely that this is the cause of the problem'. In Spanish: <em><b>"es muy poco probable"</b></em>.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Interruptions in a meeting</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following part of a department performance meeting where Steve and Jill are making recommendations to the customer service department for changes to be made in their department.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Steve:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Over the last four weeks, myself and Jill have gone over the performance statistics for the customer service department, the response rates, closing down enquiries'

  <p><span class="names">Steve:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It was the Sales and Service Director. <br><br>
      So, as I said we have looked at the different performance statistics and we have found that although the majority of teams are meeting their targets, they are doing it by manipulating the statistics rather than providing a good level of customer service.'
          </span></p>
          
  <p><span class="names">Fred:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Just a minute</strong>!, how can you say that? I haven't seen you down here reviewing my team!'

  <p><span class="names">Steve:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Do you mind if I finish</strong>? <br><br>
   <strong>As I was just saying</strong>, our review has shown that the level of customer service isn't up to the appropriate standard. We came to this conclusion by monitoring a random selection of responses to customer emails and customer phone calls to the service desk.'
           </span></p>
           
   <p><span class="names">Sally:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Sorry to butt in, but may I just ask</strong> what the percentage of this random sample was?'

  <p><span class="names">Jill:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>If I can just come in here</strong> Steve. I was responsible for doing the monitoring. And over a period of two weeks, we monitored on average 5% of customer calls and 3% of emails.'
              </span></p>
              
  <p><span class="names">Sally:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'To be honest I don't think that monitoring 5% of customer calls and 3% of emails gives a fair representation of the quality of service the customer service department is providing.'</span></p>
  
     
            
  <p><span class="names">Steve:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>You may have a point there</strong> and it is something that we have thought about. But it's the standard random sample size we've used before. <br><br>
  
   So, as a result of our review we have come up with a number of recommendations that we feel should be implemented to the customer service department as soon as possible. The first of these is restructuring the teams to specialize on specific customer issues rather than on geographical areas, we'</span></p>

<FORM>
<p>1. An informal and polite phrase to use when you want to interrupt someone to ask a question, is <br>
<select name="s1"  ID="q1"  onClick="Engine(1)" > 
<option value="1"></option>
<option value="Just a minute">Just a minute</option>
<option value="May I just finish">May I just finish</option>
<option value="Sorry to butt in, but may I just ask">Sorry to butt in, but may I just ask</option>
<option value="If I can just come in here">If I can just come in here</option>

<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n1')">

  <p><strong>Sorry to butt in, but may I just ask:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This structure is used when you have a question. The use of 'butt in' means that although this sentence is polite, it isn't formal. Non-native speakers will probably not understand the meaning of 'butt in', so it is better to use 'interrupt' when speaking with them.  In Spanish: <em><b>"siento interrumpirte, pero permítame decirte"</b></em>.</p>

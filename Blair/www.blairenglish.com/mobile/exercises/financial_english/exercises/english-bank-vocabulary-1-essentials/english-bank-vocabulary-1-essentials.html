 <h2>Exercise: What a bank does</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two friends, Peter explains to Juan the essential English vocabulary connected to banks.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 

 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You used to work in a bank. How do they make so much money?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, banks <strong>lend</strong> money to people when they don't have enough money to buy or pay for something (e.g. a car or a house). Then the people <strong>repay</strong> the money back to the bank in the future.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I have <strong>borrowed</strong> money from the bank before to buy both my car and my house and to pay for the cost of my university course. In fact, I still have a <strong>loan</strong> from the bank for my house, I borrowed £240,000 from my bank to buy it. So that's how a bank makes money, from loans?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. Banks don't lend money to people for free, they charge <strong>interest</strong> on all the loans they give to people. On the loan I have to pay for my car, they charge me 8% interest per year. So every year I haven't repaid the loan from them, I have to pay them 8% in interest (8% of the original value of loan) in addition to repaying to them the actual money they gave me to buy the car.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'8% interest per year isn't a lot for borrowing money from a bank. I have a bank account where I can borrow money from my bank when I want. With this <strong>credit card account</strong>, my bank charges me 20% interest per year for borrowing money from them. Normally, I repay the money quickly, so I don't get charged interest.'
 <br>
 <br>
 'But where do the bank get the money from to give loans to people?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They borrow the money.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'From who?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Normally from the people and companies who <strong>deposit</strong> or give their money to the bank to look after. Anybody who has a bank account (except a credit card account) with them.'</span></p>

 

 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What types of bank accounts are there?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There are two main different types of bank accounts where people deposit their money. The first type is the one which people use to buy or pay for things with (e.g. in a shop, on the internet, bills etc...) and you can take out money from it whenever you want. This is called a <strong>current account</strong> or a checking account in America. This is the type of bank account which most people's salary/wage from their job is paid into.'
 
 <br>
 <br>
 'The second type of bank account is used for people who want to save not spend the money that is deposited in the account. This is called a <strong>savings account</strong>. With this type of account you can't use it to buy or pay for things (e.g. in a supermarket) like with a current account. To use the money in a savings account, you can only withdraw/take the money out directly from the bank or move it into your current account.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So why do people have a savings account then? A current account seems more practical.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Because banks pay interest on the money in your savings account. They give you money for keeping money in the account.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And the banks don't pay you interest for the money in your current account?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes they do. But the <strong>interest rate</strong>, the percentage of interest you receive, is higher in a savings account than in a current account. In my savings account, my money in it earns 5% interest rate each year. While in my current account, the bank only pays an interest rate of 1%.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, if a bank pays the people who deposit money with them interest, how can it make money?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Because the interest rate it pays to borrow money (from its customers who deposit money) is lower than the interest rate it charges when it lends money to people (e.g. in loans). That's how it makes so much money.'</span></p>

This type of bank account is where people and companies deposit their own money so they can get access to it (to withdraw or buy/pay for things). Most 'current accounts' come with a 'debit card' (to buy things with) and some come with a cheque book (so they can pay people with cheques).<br><br>Although most banks pay interest on the money which is in a 'current account', the interest rate is normally low (1% or below per year is very common). To earn more interest on money deposited in a bank, a 'savings account' is a better option (an annual interest rate of 4% or more is common in 'savings accounts'). But unlike a 'current account', you can't pay for things directly with 'savings account'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"cuenta corriente"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Deposit:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to deposit'. This means to 'add' or to 'put in' (which is commonly used) money into a bank account. For example, "I've just deposited $120 into my current/checking account". You can use 'to make a deposit' instead of 'to deposit'.<br><br>The opposite of 'to deposit' is 'to withdraw', which means to 'take out'/'remove' your money from a bank account.<br><br>When 'deposit' is used as a noun, it normally has a different meaning in financial English. It means the money that you have to pay somebody to either use something (e.g. to hire car or to rent a house) or to secure the purchase of something that costs a lot of money (e.g. a house or a car). For example, 'I paid a $5,000 deposit on the house, now I'm waiting on the bank loan to buy it'. In both cases, if something happens to the thing you are using (e.g. it is damaged) or you decide not to buy the object, you could lose the money you have paid in the 'deposit'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"ingresar/depositar"</b></em>.</p>

In 'savings accounts' the bank pays you an OK interest rate (4% or more per year is common) so that you keep your money in the account.

  <p><strong>Interest rate:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> Normally the 'interest' that people have to pay when they have a loan is shown as a percentage, this is called the 'interest rate'. This 'interest rate' shows how much extra money the person has to pay for borrowing money and is calculated on how much money you originally borrowed (called the 'principal'). For example, if you borrow '£1,000' from a bank and the 'interest rate' you have to pay is 7%, the 'interest' you have to pay is £70 (the amount you have to pay back to the bank in total is for borrowing for money is £1,070).<br><br>With most bank loans the 'interest rate' is annual, which means that each year you have a loan you have to pay the ‘interest rate’ again to the bank. For example, if you borrowed £1,000 from the bank again (with an 7% annual interest rate) and it took you 2 years to pay it back, you would have to pay £140 in interest (£70 for each year).<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"tasa/tipo de interés"</b></em>.</p>

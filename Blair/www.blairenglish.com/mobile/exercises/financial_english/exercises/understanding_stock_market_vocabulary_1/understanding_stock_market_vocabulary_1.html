<p class="openParaArticle">A lot of people today invest their own money in shares (owning a small part of a company)
either directly through buying the shares themselves on the stock market or indirectly
through the people managing their pension scheme investing their money on the stock market
for them. The stock market seems to have its own vocabulary which can be confusing for
even people who work in the stock market.</p>

<p>In this first of three online exercises on stock market and share vocabulary, we will look at and explain the meaning of some essential
terminology that is used in English when talking about the stock market and shares.</p>

<p>Some of the vocabulary you will learn here is a little basic. I have included them in this first exercise because it is essential to understand what they mean when learning the more advanced stock market vocabulary in the later exercises.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Explaining stock market terminology</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two work colleagues, Peter explains to Juan how
the stock market works and the meaning of some different words and terms used when talking about it.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'm thinking about investing my money in the stock market and buying some shares.
The problem is that I have no idea about it. For example, what's the difference between
<strong>stocks</strong> and shares?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Basically, they are the same thing. They mean the ownership of part of a company.
In Britain, we normally say shares, but in North America they use both.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Can I buy shares for any company in the world on the stock market?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, you can only buy stocks and shares on the stock market for <strong>public limited
companies</strong> (called 'public corporations' in America). These are generally big companies which allow anybody to buy shares in
them. In fact, only companies which are public limited companies are on the stock
market. The majority of companies in the world are <strong>private limited companies</strong> (called 'private corporations' in America),
which don't sell their shares on the stock market.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, how do I buy stocks or shares in these public limited companies? Can I do it
myself by calling the companies?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, you don't have the permission to buy shares yourself, you have to get a
<strong>stockbroker</strong> to buy or sell shares for you. A stockbroker is licenced/registered to
<strong>trade</strong> stocks and shares (which means to buy or sell stocks and shares) on stock
exchanges. So you have to set up an account with a stockbroker.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok. So what's the difference between a <strong>stock exchange</strong> and the stock
market?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The stock market means anywhere where stocks and shares are traded, but a stock
exchange means an actual location/organisation where they are traded. For example, the
actual place/organisation in London where stocks and shares are traded for some
companies is called the London Stock Exchange. In New York, you have the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. All three stock exchanges are part of
the stock market.'</span></p>

 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So why does New York have two stock exchanges?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There are actually more in New York. Each stock exchange has different companies
<strong>listed</strong> on them. So, if you want to buy shares in Google your stockbroker has to
use the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, because that's where Google is listed and their shares
are traded. But if you want to buy shares in Ford, your stockbroker has to use the New
York Stock Exchange, because that's the stock exchange where Ford is listed.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'More complicated than I thought. I would like get a good <strong>return</strong> from the
shares, I want to make a lot of money. Do you have any recommendations on what
company's shares I should buy?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I don't know. You should get advice from a stockbroker or look at how a company's
shares are performing. Check to see if the share value has increased or decreased. When
you own shares in a company you will become a <strong>shareholder</strong> which means you
are a part owner of the company and can vote on who manages or directs the company.
You will also receive a <strong>dividend</strong> on each share you own, which is an extra
payment. If the company is making a profit they normally give some of this profit to their
shareholders as a dividend. So your return with be a combination of the dividend and the
increase or decrease in the share price.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But can I get a higher return on my money if I put my money in the bank from the
interest than from the dividend in stocks and shares.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's safer to put your money in a bank, but you may make more money with stocks
and shares. If you want to see how much money you earn on each dollar or pound you
have invested, you have to look at the <strong>yield</strong>. For example, if a banks pays you an
interest rate of 2%, you earn 2% on every $1 and this 2% is called the yield. For dividends
you have to divide the yearly dividend per share by the amount you paid for the share. So,
if a share cost you $2.50 and the yearly dividend is 15 cents, you divide 15 by 250. So the
yield for the share is 6%. So this shows you would make a higher return on your money
from investing in this company's shares than by putting your money in the the bank.'</span></p>

the owners/shareholders have 'limited liability' (where the owners/shareholders will only

companies', if one of the owners/shareholders wants to sell their shares in the company
they first have to offer them to the other owners/shareholders first before offering them to somebody else. The name 'private limited company' is used in the majority of countries
where English is spoken except for America. In America, they are often called 'private
corporations', but they can also be called other names there as well. In Spanish: <em><b>"sociedad/compañia limitada privada"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Dividend:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'dividend' is a payment which companies pay/give to the owners of its shares
when it makes a profit. When a company makes a profit, it has to decide what it wants to
do with the money. Normally, companies give some of this profit to their shareholders as a
'dividend' on each share they own. For example, if a company pays a 'dividend' of $1.20
on each share, if you own 1000 in the company, you will receive $1,200 in 'dividends'. But
often companies keep (or retain) some of this profit. This is called 'retained earnings'.
Normally, companies use the money they keep as 'retained earnings' to reinvest in the
company (e.g. to buy machinery, other companies, buildings etc...), to save for the future
or to pay off debts and loans that they have. In Spanish: <em><b>"dividendo"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Stock exchange:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'stock exchange' is the place/organisation where the 'trading' (the buying and
selling) of stocks and shares happens. When a company decides to sell its shares to the public, they
choose a place/organisation where people can buy its shares from. This is called a 'stock
exchange'. There are over a 100 different 'stock exchanges' in the world. New York has 3
different 'stock exchanges' of which the 'New York Stock Exchange' and the 'NASDAQ' are
the two most famous. So, if you wanted to buy shares in Microsoft, the only place/organisation you can buy or sell them on is the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York.
Although not common, some companies shares are traded (bought and sold) on more
than one 'stock exchange'. For example, the shares for the oil company BP are traded on
both the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. The 'stock market'
has a different meaning to 'stock exchange'. The 'stock market' means all the places/organisations where stocks and shares are bought and sold, which includes all the
different 'stock exchanges'. In Spanish: <em><b>"bolsa de valores"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Stocks:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'stocks' or 'stock' has many different meanings. In this context it means to have an
investment in a company where you own a part of the company. It has the same meaning
as 'shares'. 'stocks' is commonly used in North America, while 'shares' is commonly used
everywhere else. For example, 'I own a lot stock in the company' has the same meaning
as 'I own a lot shares in the company'. But there is a difference between the use of 'stocks' and
'shares'. When a company sells the ownership of the company on the stock market, it sells
units or pieces with a value/price. Each unit or piece of ownership in a company is
called a 'share' (in both North America and the rest of the world). So if you want to tell
somebody how many actual units/pieces or 'shares' you have in a company you can say 'I
have 500 shares in Apple', but you can't use 'I have 500 stocks in Apple'. 'stock(s)' is not
used to specify how many units of ownership or 'shares' you have in a company, but is
used to say that you have/own units of ownership or 'shares' in a company. So, both 'I have
stock in Apple' and 'I have
shares in Apple' are correct. It is a little confusing.  In Spanish: <em><b>"acciones"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Public limited companies:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'public limited company' is a type company whose shares are traded (sold or bought) on the stock
market and can be bought by the 'public'. 'public limited companies' (which is often shortened to
'plc' at the end of a company name, e.g. 'Lloyds plc') are normally large to very large
companies where the owners/shareholders have 'limited liability' (where the owners/
shareholders will only lose the money they have invested in the company if the company
goes bankrupt/closes down because of financial problems). Companies whose shares
aren't and can't be sold on the stock market (to the public) but whose owners/shareholders
have limited liability, are called 'private limited companies'. The name 'public limited
company' is used in the majority of countries where English is spoken except for America. In America, they are often called 'public
corporations', but they can also be called other names there as well. In Spanish: <em><b>"sociedad/compañia pública de responsabilidad limitada"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Trade:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to trade'. This verb is commonly used in the stock market. It
basically means the process of 'buying' and 'selling'. In the stock market, it means the
'buying' and 'selling' of shares/stock on stock exchanges. 'trade' is also used to say in
which stock exchange shares are bought and sold, e.g. 'shares in Apple are traded at the
Nasdaq Stock Exchange'. In addition to these, the verb is also used to say at what
price shares/stock in a company is being bought and sold at (the market value of the share/stock). To
do this, you have to place the preposition 'at' between the verb and the price, e.g. 'shares
in Apple are trading at $120.50, down $2.45 from their price this morning'. In Spanish: <em><b>"comerciar"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Return:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'return' basically means the 'profit' you make/earn (e.g. interest, dividend,
increase in value etc...) from investing your money. This can be from buying and selling
stocks and shares, bonds, investing in a company, putting your money in a bank etc...
Normally, a 'return' is measured as a percentage. 'return' has a very similar meaning to
'yield', but there is a difference in what is included when they are calculated. With stocks
and shares, the 'return' combines the 'dividend' (the extra payment you receive for owning
a share) and the increase in the share's value on the stock market. With 'yield', only the
'dividend' is used to calculate it and not the increase in share value. For example, with
shares in Apple, if you bought its shares in January 2009 when they had a price of $82.33
and then sold them in January 2011 when they had a price of $348.48, the 'return' on your
investment would be be nearly 350%. But because Apple didn't pay its shareholders any
'dividends' on the shares they owned at this time, the 'yield' would have been 0%. In Spanish: <em><b>"retorno/rendimiento/rentabilidad"</b></em>.</p>

more commonly used to say in which stock exchange (e.g. New York Stock Exchange,
London Stock Exchange etc...) a company's shares are traded. This verb is used to talk
about companies and is normally used in the passive (to be listed), followed by the
preposition 'on' and the name of the stock exchange, e.g. 'Apple is listed on the NASDAQ'. In Spanish: <em><b>"cotizar en bolsa"</b></em>.</p>

their clients and charges a fee/commission each time they trade stocks and shares for

should buy and sell (these 'stockbrokers' are often called 'full-service brokers'). Other 'stockbrokers' only
trade stocks and shares for their clients and don't offer any advice. These are often called

 <h2>Exercise: Borrowing money from a bank</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two friends, Peter explains to Juan about borrowing money from a bank and the possible problems that people have when repaying a loan.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Why do people borrow money from a bank?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They borrow money from a bank if they need or want to buy or pay for something and they don't have enough money to do it. The main way people borrow money is in a loan, where they borrow a fixed or set amount of money (e.g. £10,000). They have to pay it all back to the bank within a fixed amount of time (e.g. 2 years, 30 years etc...).<br><br>Normally, people have to pay back to the bank some of the money they borrowed each month until they have paid the bank all the money that they owe them. This money people pay back to the bank each month for a loan is called a monthly <strong>repayment</strong>.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How much interest do banks charge on loans?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It depends on both the <strong>credit history</strong> of the person applying for a loan and how long they are going to repay it for.<br><br>Before giving somebody a loan, banks look at a report (called a credit history) which shows the history of the loans that the person both has had and still has to repay. If the person has had problems repaying/paying back loans in the past, then they will have a bad credit history and the bank will charge them a higher interest rate than somebody who has a good credit history (who has had no problems repaying loans in the past).<br><br>In addition, the interest rate a person has to pay also depends on how long the person is going to take to repay the loan to the bank. Banks charge people interest during the time they are repaying money for a loan back to them (e.g. 6% interest each year a loan is being repaid). So for a bank to make money, the interest rate would have to be higher for a loan where you repay it all over 6 months than one where you repay it all over 30 years. A loan used to buy a house, which is called a <strong>mortgage</strong>, normally has a low interest rate because it takes a long time to repay it (between 20 to 30 years).'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And does the interest rate on a loan change while you repay the loan?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It depends on what type of interest rate your loan has. Some loans have a <strong>variable rate</strong> of interest, where the interest rate can go up and down because of the changes in inflation (one year it's 7%, the next it's 5%). Other loans have a <strong>fixed rate</strong> of interest, where the interest rate you pay on the loan stays the same until you have repaid all the loan.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There are also other ways that you can borrow money from a bank. A common way that businesses use to borrow money is called a <strong>line of credit</strong>. This is a special type of account where a bank agrees to give a business the ability to borrow money from them when they need to.'</span></p>

   
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But isn't that a loan?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Not really, because with a line of credit a business is given an amount it can use/borrow (e.g. £7,000) if it wants to. The business can choose to borrow as little or as much of that money when it wants (e.g. it could use £5 or the full £7,000). It's more like a credit card than a loan (where you borrow a fixed amount).'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Is a line of credit the same thing as an <strong>overdraft</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It’s very similar, but an overdraft is where the bank allows/permits its customers to use or withdraw more money than they have in their current/checking accounts when they want to. Whereas a line of credit is only given to business customers, overdrafts are normally given to both business and non-business customers.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So with both a line of credit and an overdraft, the customers can borrow as much money as they want from the bank?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No. The bank sets/gives an <strong>overdraft limit</strong> or credit limit (for lines of credit) on how much their customers can borrow from them. Which means a maximum amount of money they can borrow/use.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What happens if somebody withdraws or spends more money than the limit of the overdraft or line of credit?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It depends on the bank. Some banks won't allow them to withdraw or spend the money and tell them they have <strong>insufficient funds</strong>. Which basically means they don't have the money in their bank account or they have gone over their overdraft limit. Other banks will allow them to withdraw or spend the money, but then the customer will have to pay <strong>bank charges</strong>, which is extra money they have to pay to the banks. These bank charges can be very high.'</span></p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what happens if you can't pay the money that you have borrowed back to a bank?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When a bank sees that a loan repayment is <strong>overdue</strong>, which means it hasn't been paid when it should have been and it is late, they will contact the person who has the loan or borrowed the money and ask them to pay it.<br><br>Normally, the person will have to pay bank charges for the overdue repayment. If the person or company <strong>defaults</strong> on the loan, which means they can't or won't repay the loan to the bank, the bank will try different ways to try to get the money they have loaned/lent to them back. Not paying back/defaulting on a loan, will give the person or company a bad credit history.'</span></p>

  <p><strong>Line of credit:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'line of credit' is a short-term loan (i.e. the money is paid back to the bank quickly) where the bank provides their customer with a quantity of money they can use instantly if they need or want to. 'lines of credit' always have a maximum limit and unlike a normal loan (where the customer borrows a fixed amount of money), it is the decision of the customer how much of the money available in the 'line of credit' they do or don't use. In many ways it is the same as a 'credit card', but only for businesses or companies.<br><br>

An 'overdraft' is similar to a 'line of credit'. Whereas a 'line of credit' is normally a separate bank account, an 'overdraft' is an extension to an existing checking/current bank account (both for business and non-business accounts), which allows the person/company to use more money than is in their bank account (basically borrow money from the bank).<br><br>

The reason banks give businesses a line of credit, is because there is normally a delay between making/selling products or providing a service and actually being paid for them. A line of credit helps businesses survive during this time.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"línea de crédito"</b></em>.</p>

It is used if you don't have enough money in your current/checking account or if you gone over/exceeded your 'overdraft limit' or 'credit card limit'.<br><br>

  <p><strong>Defaults:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em>  The infinitive is 'to default'. This is the situation when somebody who has a loan from a bank is unable or unwilling (doesn't want to) repay the loan to the bank. For example, 'Simon has defaulted on his mortgage'.<br><br>

There are various consequences of a person 'defaulting'. Bank will normally first try to restructure loan repayments (you pay less each month but for longer). If this doesn't work/help they can repossess (take ownership of) some of your property (your house or car). This normally happens if the loan is a 'secured loan' like a mortgage or a car loan. For loans for a small quantity of money they may 'write it off', which means they'll just stop trying to get you to give them the money.<br><br>

No matter what the bank does, when a person 'defaults' on a loan it will affect the person's 'credit history'. Making it more difficult in the future for the person to borrow money and increasing the amount of interest that they have to pay if they can.<br><br>  In Spanish: <em><b>"incumplir/no pagar"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Overdraft:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> This is a type of short-term loan (i.e. the money is paid back to the bank quickly) where the bank provides their customer with a quantity of money if they have no money left in their bank account. 'overdrafts' are normally used with current/checking accounts. With an 'overdraft', the bank allows the person to continue spending money from  their account when their account balance has reached zero. 'overdrafts' always have a maximum limit (called an 'overdraft limit') which the person/company can use.<br><br>
An 'overdraft' is similar to a 'line of credit'. Whereas a 'line of credit' is normally a separate bank account, an 'overdraft' is an extension to an existing checking/current bank account (both for business and non-business accounts).<br><br>  In Spanish: <em><b>"sobregiro/descubierto"</b></em>.</p>

With a loan, you will normally have to pay 'bank charges' if you are late making a loan repayment.

This is a record of what a person or business has borrowed both in the past and the present, if they have had problems repaying the borrowed money, how many loans a person has been refused and how many times somebody has requested to see their 'credit history'.<br><br>'credit histories' are used by bank to see what the risk is of lending a person or business money (the chance of them not repaying the money). They use a person's or business's 'credit history' to help them decide both if they should give a loan to the person/company and what interest rate they should charge (the worse the 'credit history', the higher the interest rate).<br><br>
Most 'credit histories' also contain a 'credit score' (sometimes called a 'credit rating' for companies). This is a number (between 300-850) which shows the risk of lending the person or business money (the lower the number, the lower the risk of the person/company defaulting/not paying the money back).<br><br>
A person or business will have a bad 'credit history' and 'credit score' if they have had problems repaying loans in the past. Also, if they currently have a lot of loans to repay, their 'credit history' will be seen as worse (and more of a risk) than somebody who currently doesn't have any or fewer loans to repay.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"historial de crédito"</b></em>.</p>

  <p>In the first two parts of this online exercise on shares & stock market terminology, we looked at both <a href="../../../../../exercises/financial_english/exercises/understanding_stock_market_vocabulary_1/understanding_stock_market_vocabulary_1.html"><b>the essential vocabulary</b></a> used for
understanding stocks/shares and the stock market, and some <a href="../../../../../exercises/financial_english/exercises/understanding_stock_market_vocabulary_2/understanding_stock_market_vocabulary_2.html"><b>more advanced vocabulary</b></a> used for the stock market. In this third of three online exercises,
we will continue to look at more advanced terminology and vocabulary about the stock market. In particular, the
different ways that stocks/shares are first sold on the stock market by companies and how
this can affect their share price.</p> <p>In this part, we will also be looking at and explaining some
commonly used stock market vocabulary and terms which are confusing to understand.

<p>After you have done this exercise, I would recommend that you do our online exercise on <a href="../../../../../exercises/financial_english/exercises/understanding_stock_market_calculations/understanding_stock_market_calculations.html"><strong>stock market calculations</strong></a>. A difficult topic, but one which is essential for understanding the stock market.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Explaining the stock market continued</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two work colleagues, Peter explains more to Juan about
how the stock market works and the meaning of some different words and terms used in it.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Any more advice on what stock/shares I should or shouldn't buy?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'From my experience, I would say you shouldn't try to buy shares or stock in
companies when they first go public, when they first start to sell their shares on the stock
market. This is called an <strong>IPO</strong> which stands for Initial Public Offering. Normally, the
price of the shares in these companies will decrease a few days after they have started
being traded (bought and sold) on the stock market.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What can I do if the price of the shares I have in a company falls a lot in a single
day. Should I sell them even if it's a lot below the exit point I previously decided that I would sell them at?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You can't do a lot apart from selling them or keeping them. Often, if the share price of a company falls a lot during one day, the
company will ask the stock exchange to <strong>suspend trading</strong> its shares. This means
that no one can buy or sell the company's shares, so the price of the shares won't change
or fall further.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There seems to be a lot of risk in buying stocks and shares. Maybe, I should buy
<strong>financial securities</strong> instead?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You do know that stocks and shares are a type of financial securities?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'To be honest, I don't know what financial securities mean.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Financial securities are normally just called securities. Bank notes, stocks and
shares, bonds etc... are all different types of securities. Securities are financial contracts
which can be bought and sold by different people. So, with a share, it is a financial contract
where the company says you are a part owner of the company. You can buy the share and then sell it
to anybody you like.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I've read something about <strong>stock split</strong>, where a company reduced the value
and price of their shares. Does that mean that the people who own shares in that company
will lose money?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, it doesn't mean that. When companies think that their stock or share price is too
expensive for people/investors to buy (for example, $120 a share), they may decide to
reduce the price of the shares by 50%, so they are easier for people to buy. But the
shareholders who own that company's shares will be given double the amount of shares
that they had before, so they don't lose any money.'</span></p>


 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So the company increases the number of shares it has, but the value of the total
number of shares doesn't change. But isn't that the same thing as a rights issue?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's similar, but the purpose is different. A <strong>rights issue</strong> is when a company
decides to create completely new shares in the company and then offers them to its
existing shareholders to buy at a reduced/discounted price. The company does this to
directly make/raise money to invest in the company. The result will be that the average
share price will fall, but anybody who bought the shares will have made a profit because
they bought them at a reduced price.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So what is a <strong>secondary offering</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A secondary offering is when some shareholders (normally part-owners of the
company before it went public) who own a large <strong>stake</strong> in the company (e.g. their stake in a company is 10% of the company's shares), decide to sell a large amount of their existing shares
(not newly created ones) to the public on the stock market. When a company goes public,
normally the majority of shares are kept by these original part owners. And only a part of
the ownership of the company is sold to public investors on the stock market (for example,
30% of the ownership of the company). This percentage/amount of shares of a company
which are traded (bought and sold) on the stock market is called the <strong>public float</strong>,
shares that anybody can buy. The rest of the shares are normally still kept by the original
owners and the company's employees or by very large investors who have some control
over the company. So with a secondary offering, the percentage of the company's shares
which are part of the public float increases (for example, from 30% to 45%).'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I thought that the name for all the shares of a company that could be bought by the
public on the stock market was outstanding shares? But you said they were called the
public float.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'<strong>Outstanding shares</strong>, is different. As I said before, the public float is the
shares owned by the public and that are traded on the stock market. But there are other
shares which are owned by employees of the company and owners of the company before
it went public. These shares have restrictions on when or how they can be sold to other
people and are called restrictive shares. So, the outstanding shares is a combination of
both all the shares in the public float and all the shares which are restrictive.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'One of my friends from university works in a multinational military manufacturer and
he told me they have just won a $2 billion contract, but nobody outside the company
knows about it. Should I buy shares in the company?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If nobody outside the company knows about this contract, then it is illegal to use this
information to buy shares, because you know that the price of the shares will increase.
This is called <strong>insider trading</strong> and if the authorities or police find out, you can go to
prison.'</span></p>

'she owns 5% of the company'. 'stake' is normally used with percentages. In addition, it is
normally only used when somebody owns a lot of shares in a company (1% or above). In Spanish: <em><b>"participación/intereses"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Stock split:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'stock spilt' is a planned reduction in the cost of a share in a company. This is done  when a company believes that the price of its share is too high/expensive for normal investors to buy. With a 'stock split', the company decides to reduce/decrease the price of their shares to encourage more people to buy them. They do this by
increasing the number of their shares in the stock market. Both before and after a 'stock
split', the total value of all the shares a company has in the stock market stays the same,
it's just the number of their shares have increased. Any current/existing owner of their
shares will receive additional shares when the 'stock split' happens, so they don't lose any
money. For example, if a company has a share price of $90 and it decides to do a 'stock
split' where they reduce their share price by two thirds (to $30 a share), an existing owner
of its shares who has 100 shares, will receive 200 additional shares after the 'stock split'
takes place. In Spanish: <em><b>"división de acciones/split"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Insider trading:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'insider trading' basically means 'cheating'. It is when a person uses information
about a company or a country to trade (buy or sell) in stocks and shares before this
information is made public. For example, if your brother works in a company which has just
made a very large profit, but nobody else apart from you and some people who work in the
company know about this, it is illegal to buy shares in this company before the news of the
very large profit is made public. The reason why, is that this information will give you an
unfair advantage over other people who don't know about the company's very large profit.
If you do buy shares in the company, you will benefit financially as the share price of the
company will increase when the news of the very large profit is made public. This is called
'insider trading', which is using privileged information for your own financial benefit.
'insider trading' not only happens in the stock market, but with the sale of any type of
financial securities (e.g. bonds, currencies etc...). In Spanish: <em><b>"transacciones que aprovechan información privilegiada"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Rights issue:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'rights issue' is when a company creates completely new shares in the company
and then tries to sell them to its shareholders. The reason it does this is to make/raise
money (it is often done when they need extra money to make a large investment like to
buy another company). Because a 'rights issue' increases the total number of shares for a
company, but the total value of the company doesn't change, the price of each company
share will decrease/fall as a consequence (this is called to 'dilute the stock'). With a 'rights
issue', the company has to offer the new shares to their existing shareholders first. They
normally offer the new shares at both a lower price than the current share price and with
an additional discount/reduction in price (so when the share price falls the shareholders
who have bought the new shares should make a profit). For example, the price of a
company's share before a 'rights issue' is $4. The company offers the new shares in the
'rights issue' at a price of $3.50, but to existing shareholders it adds a discount of 30 cent
per share, so the shareholders only have to pay $3.20 per share. After the 'rights issue',
the share price on the stock market falls to $3.70 because of the new shares that have
been added. In Spanish: <em><b>"emisión de derechos de suscripción"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Financial securities:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'financial securities' are commonly called just 'securities'. Basically, they are
'financial contracts' whose ownership can be traded (bought and sold) between people.
One common type of 'securities' are stocks and shares. A share, is basically a financial
contract between the company and the shareholder, which says that the shareholder owns
a part of the company. The share can then be sold by the shareholder to another person,
who can then sell it to another person if they want. Another type of 'securities' are bonds (a
type of loan which a government or company issues when it borrows money from
investors). This is a financial contract where the company/government promises to pay the
person who owns the bond the value of what the bond was issued or originally sold at (e.g.
€10,000) at a fixed date in the future (e.g. 02/10/2018) plus pay the bond owner a fixed
interest rate per year (e.g. 5%). Like shares, the ownership of the bond can be traded
between people. Other types of 'financial securities' are currencies (e.g. bank notes) and
derivatives.  In Spanish: <em><b>"valores financieros"</b></em>.</p>

market) or investors who own a large quantity of shares in the company and use them to
direct/influence how the company is run/managed (who are often called 'controlling interest
investors' and are often the owners of the company before it became a Public
Limited Company). For example, the 'public float' in Apple is over 99% of all the

  <p><strong>Secondary offering:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> Basically, this means when a large number of shares in a company are sold for the
first time on the stock market for the public to buy. A 'secondary offering' normally happens
months or years after a company goes public and first sells its shares in the
'IPO'/'flotation'. Normally, only a part of a company's shares are sold to the public in the
'IPO'/'flotation'. The rest of the shares are kept by the original owners and employees. With
a 'secondary offering', normally some or one of these original owners sell part or all of their
shares to the public through the stock market. All the money earned from the sale of
shares in a 'secondary offering' goes to the previous owner of the shares and not to the
company.  In Spanish: <em><b>"ofrecimiento secundario"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Suspend trading:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This basically means that no shares of a company can be bought or sold on a
stock exchange. There are several reasons why the trading of shares is suspended. A
company can ask for trading of its shares to be 'suspended' because its about to
announce some important news to the stock market (e.g. a merger or takeover) or
because the price of its shares has fallen dramatically and they fear they will fall a lot more
(e.g. 'when there are rumours of big problems at the company'). The stock exchange can
also suspend the trading of a company's shares. This normally happens when the
company has broken stock exchange rules/regulations or is being investigated for doing
serious illegal activities (e.g. fraud). In Spanish: <em><b>"transacciones bursátiles suspendidas"</b></em>.</p>

   <div id="introduction">

<p>Choosing a loan can be a difficult experience. If you want to get the best deal, you have to
do a lot of work (searching for loans, contacting banks, applying for loans etc...). And some
banks and lending institutions don't make it easy. They use vocabulary/terminology which
most normal people may have heard before, but do not fully understand. This can cause
problems in the future for those who have taken out the loan.</p> 

<p>To help you understand what
these different words and phrases for loans mean, you will find an exercise below that will
explain them in normal English. Doing this exercise will help you both understand and
remember this lending vocabulary better and ensure that you can decide which loan is
best for you.</p> 

<p>After you have done this exercise, you can also improve your knowledge of the English vocabulary used for <a href="../../../../../exercises/financial_english/exercises/english-bank-vocabulary-1-essentials/english-bank-vocabulary-1-essentials.html"><strong>banking in general</strong></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/financial_english/exercises/understanding_stock_market_vocabulary_1/understanding_stock_market_vocabulary_1.html"><strong>the stock market</strong></a> or <a href="../../../../../exercises/financial_english/exercises/deciding_insurance_policy_to_choose/deciding_insurance_policy_to_choose.html"><strong>insurance</strong></a> in our online exercises on these financial topics.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Commonly used loan vocabulary</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation between Peter and Eric. Peter is advising his friend Eric
what he has to think about when deciding which loan to choose.</p> 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 

 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Peter, you know a lot about loans. I'm looking for a personal loan at the moment to build a swimming pool and don't want to make any mistakes.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No problem. Are you looking to get a <strong>secured loan</strong> where the loan is
guaranteed by your property, or an <strong>unsecured loan</strong> where it's not connected to your property?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'd prefer to not go for a secured loan. I don't want the bank to take my house if can't pay the loan back. I'd prefer an unsecured loan.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'An unsecured loan is less risky for you, because there's no possibility of losing your property. But because it's more risky for the lender or bank, the interest rate is higher. So
it's more expensive, you'll pay a higher interest rate on the loan. How much do you want the <strong>principal</strong> of the loan to be?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What does the principal of the loan mean?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The principal means the amount of money you want to borrow.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The principal will be Â£15,000. I'd like a <strong>repayment period</strong> of four years, so I will have paid all the money back to the bank in that time. Also, is the interest rate the
same as the <strong>Annual Percentage Rate</strong>?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'More or less yes. The Annual Percentage Rate or APR does show how much interest
you pay on the loan each year that you have the loan. But the APR also includes fees or
additional costs that the bank charges you for obtaining the loan, like loan processing or
administration fees. So, if the bank charges a yearly interest rate of 6% on loans, with the
fees and additional costs included, you'll actually pay them 6.14%. This 6.14% is what is
called the Annual Percentage Rate. Have you thought what type of interest rate you
want the loan to have?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, I thought about <strong>variable rate</strong>. You know, an interest rate which can go up and down because of the changes in inflation.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's one option. There's also <strong>fixed rate</strong>, where the interest rate you pay on the loan stays the same throughout the whole repayment period of the loan. Then
there's <strong>split rate</strong>, where part of the interest you pay is variable and the other part is
fixed.'</span></p>

  
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'll have to look into it. I've heard about a <strong>preferential rate</strong>. What type of interest rate is that?'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If you are an existing customer of a bank or lending institution, sometimes the bank will offer you an interest rate on a loan that is lower than what they normally offer. This is
what a preferential rate is.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok. I'll speak to my bank.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Eric, what you must do when deciding on choosing a loan is to look at the <strong>terms and conditions</strong> for it.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's the loan contract information, which people often call the small print.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. You need to read it. It contains all the information about the <strong>fees</strong> that you have to pay to the bank for the loan. You know the additional costs like processing the loan application or for administration. Also, in the terms and conditions you'll find what the <strong>charges</strong> are. This is what you have to pay the bank if one of your repayments is late. For some loans, the charges can be really high.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I don't think I'll have a problem repaying it. In fact, I should be able to pay off the loan early. Although I'm going to ask for a 4 year repayment period, I should be able to pay the loan off in a little over 3 years.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That could be a problem. Have a look in the small print to see what it says about <strong>redemption penalties</strong>. Some banks and lending institutions charge you money if you try to repay the loan back early. These are called redemption penalties.'</span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Eric:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Thanks, I will.'</span></p>

  <p><strong>Variable rate:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> 'variable rate' or 'flexible rate' is one of three main ways/methods that you can pay interest on a loan. It basically means that the interest you pay will change/vary during the length of repaying a loan. The interest rate will change depending on the rate of inflation (the increase in the price of products in the economy as a whole) and others
factors. To choose a 'variable rate' on a loan could be a gamble, because although the
amount you paid in interest can go down, it can also go up. The other two main methods of
paying interest, are: 'fixed rate' (where the interest you pay doesn't change throughout the
period of a loan) and 'split rate' (where a part of the interest you pay on a loan is 'fixed rate'
and the other part is 'variable rate'). In Spanish: <em><b>"tasa variable"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Repayment period:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> The 'repayment period' is the total length of time that it takes a customer to repay/pay back the loan to the the bank or lending institution. The 'repayment period' is always established/confirmed before the loan is given to the customer. With many loans, the customer can decide within limits how long they want the 'repayment period' to be, e.g. 2
years, 10 years etc... For longer 'repayment periods', the customer's monthly repayments
(how much they pay to the bank per month) to the bank for the loan will be less than for
shorter 'repayment periods', but the overall cost of the loan will be more expensive
because of the more years of interest on the loan. With many loans it is possible to change
the 'repayment period' when you have already started to pay back the loan. But, if you
want the 'repayment period' to be shorter than you agreed to when you accepted the loan,
the bank will often charge you 'redemption penalties', which is extra money you have
to pay on top of the loan. In Spanish: <em><b>"perÃ­odo de reembolso/pago"</b></em>.</p>

banks or lending institutions do it to reward their existing customers and to make

change the interest rate) and borrower (e.g. repay the loan) have to do and what will happen if either of them don't do them (e.g. charge the customer for late payment). It's very important that when you are taking out a loan that you read the 'terms and conditions' on the loan contract, because a bank or lending institution can include 'terms' (e.g. paying fees that they didn't tell you about etc...), and
'conditions' (e.g. take legal possession of your property if you can't pay the loan) that can cost you more money or cause you problems in the future. In Spanish: <em><b>"tÃ©rminos y condiciones"</b></em>.</p>

So, the person won't lose their property/possessions to the bank or lending institution if they don't pay it back. But they will be taken to court and it will affect their credit rating. 'unsecured loans' are common when people want to borrow small amounts of money (e.g. a small business or personal loan). Because there is a bigger risk of the person borrowing the money not repaying it than with a 'secured loan' (where the loan is guaranteed by their possessions, property or assets), interest rates are normally higher on 'unsecured loan' than on 'secured loans'.

  <p><strong>Fixed rate:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> 'fixed rate' is one of three main ways/methods that you can pay interest on a loan. It basically means that the interest you pay doesn't change/vary during the length of repaying a loan. So you know that you will be paying the same amount of interest throughout the whole period of the loan. To choose 'fixed rate' on a loan could be a gamble, because there is a possibility that if the rate of inflation (the increase in the price of products in the economy as a whole) goes down, you could be paying more interest on the loan than if the loan had a 'variable rate' of interest (where the interest rate can go up or down). Another method of paying interest on
a loan is called 'split rate' (where a part of the interest you pay on a loan is 'fixed
rate' and the other part 'variable rate'). In Spanish: <em><b>"tasa fÃ­ja"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Redemption penalties:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> When a bank or lending institution gives you a loan, they calculate how much interest you pay on it based on your individual situation (the risk of you defaulting/not paying it back) and on the repayment period of the loan (the amount of time you have agreed to repay the loan to them). Generally, banks or lending institutions give a lower interest rate for people who agree to longer repayment payments. This is because they have more years to earn interest from the loan. If a customer wants to repay a loan earlier than what they agreed to when they took out the loan (e.g. repay a loan in 3 years instead of 5 years), the bank or lending institution will lose the interest they would have earned if the customer had continued with the agreed repayment period (e.g. a loss of 2 years of interest). As a result, banks and lending institutions charge the customer to pay back a loan early. This is called 'redemption penalties'. You will find how much the 'redemption penalties' are for
repaying a loan early in the terms and conditions of the loan contract. In Spanish: <em><b>"sanciones redencÃ­on"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Fees:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'fees' is the name for the additional charges that a bank or lending institution charge a customer/borrower for getting a loan with them. There are lots of different types of 'fees' (e.g. appraisal fee, solicitor/attorney fee, credit report fee, application
fee, administration fee etc...) that a bank or lending institution can charge their customers for a loan. The 'fees' a customer can be charged on a loan depend on both the type of loan that the person is getting (a personal loan, mortgage etc...) and the bank or lending institution (some charge more 'fees' than others). So, it's important to find out what 'fees' you have to pay before signing a loan contract.
With some loans the 'fees' have to be paid at the beginning of the loan. With other loans, the 'fees' are included in the 'Annual Percentage Rate' and paid over the whole duration of a loan. In Spanish: <em><b>"cuotas/cargos"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Annual Percentage Rate:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> Is also called the 'APR'. This is a combination of the annual/yearly interest that somebody pays on a loan, plus the additional fees/charges that a bank or lending institution charge a person for getting or having a loan with them (e.g. administration fees, processing fees, service fees etc...). As a result, the 'APR' is a better indication of how much you will pay the bank or lending institution for a loan than the interest rate. For example, if you borrow $10,000 for 5 years, with annual interest of 6%, and the bank charges you $480 loan fees, you have to pay the bank for the loan a total of $13,480. So, the percentage you actually pay the bank per year for the loan is 6.96%. This 6.96% is what is called the 'APR'. Unfortunately, as with everything in finance and banking, it is a bit more complicated than this. So, you should read how the bank or lending institution generates the 'APR' for the loan in the terms and conditions. In Spanish: <em><b>"tasa porcentual anual"</b></em>.</p>

that they have agreed not to do in the loan contract. Common examples are when a customer/borrower has to pay a 'charge' for paying a repayment to the bank late or paying off a loan earlier than they originally agreed to. In fact, most banks and lending institutions no longer call this extra money that their customers have to pay them 'charges'. They normally call them 'fees' instead (e.g. late payment fee, policy cancellation fee etc...). They believe it makes them sound better. You should check the terms and conditions in the loan contract to see what 'charges' or 'fees' you may have to pay. In Spanish: <em><b>"cargo"</b></em>.</p>

With some loans with 'split rate', you may pay a 'fixed rate' of interest at the beginning of repaying the loan (e.g. the first 3 years) and then pay a 'variable rate' for the rest of the time.

<p><strong>Secured loan:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> This is a type of loan where repayment is guaranteed by the customer's (borrower's) possessions, property or assets (e.g. car, business, property etc...). So, the person can possibly lose their property/possessions to the bank/lending institution (who then sell it/them to recover the loan money) if they don't/can't pay it back. 'secured loans' are common when people want to borrow large amounts of money (e.g. a mortgage), but are also used with some small loans (e.g. a car loan). Because there is a smaller risk of the bank or lending institution losing the money
than with a 'unsecured loan' (where the loan is not guaranteed by the customer's/borrower's possessions, property or assets), interest rates are normally lower on 'secured loans' than on 'unsecured loans'. In Spanish: <em><b>"prÃ©stamo garantizado"</b></em>.</p>

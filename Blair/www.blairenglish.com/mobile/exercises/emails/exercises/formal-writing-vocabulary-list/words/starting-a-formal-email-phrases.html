   <div id="introduction">
<p>Below are some formal and polite sentences that you can use to start the first paragraph of a business or professional email or letter with.</p>

<p>The opening part of an email or letter needs to quickly inform the person reading it what both the topic/subject of it is and why you are writing to them. There are many sentences/phrases you can use to do this, but the one you need to use depends on two things:</p> 

<ul class="spacedListsBetter"><strong>
<li>If you have had contact with the person/people you are writing to before or not.</li>
<li>If you are responding/replying to something (e.g. a previous email, a phone call etc...) or not.</li>
</strong></ul>
<p>To help you select the right opening sentence for your emails or letters, I will explain below each of the following phrases in what situations they can be used in, how to use them and what to write after them.</p>

<p>To know what phrases to use to say hello and goodbye in formal emails/letters, read <a href="starting-and-ending-phrases-formal-email.html"><b><u>Starting and ending phrases for formal emails</u></b></a>.</p>

<h3 class="sentenceSynonym">I am writing in reference to...</h3>
<p class="sentenceSynonymDescrip">This phrase is used when you know or have had contact with the person/people you are writing to before, but it is the first time you've either written or spoken to them about what you are asking or informing them about in the email/letter.</p>
<a id="seeMore1" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:showtext(1);"><strong>see more</strong></a> 
<div id="sentenceBox1">
<p>You would follow this phrase by saying what the topic/subject you are writing to them about (e.g. 'the current problems with York's telephone network', 'the Johnson project' etc...).</p>

<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'I am writing in reference to next month's marketing presentation in Seattle.'</p>  
</div>

<p>Following this, you would then explain what the purpose of your email is (e.g. 'I have a few questions which I hope you could answer for me.', 'I would like to make you aware of a recent development.' etc...).</p>
<a id="seeLess1" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:hidetext(1);"><strong>see less</strong></a> 
</div><!-- /end #sentenceBox1 --> 
 


<h3 class="sentenceSynonym">I am writing with regards to...</h3>
<p class="sentenceSynonymDescrip">This is basically the same as 'I am writing in reference to', in that it is used when you know or have had contact with the person/people you are writing to before, but it is the first time you've either written or spoken to them about what you are asking or informing them about in the email/letter.</p>
<a id="seeMore2" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:showtext(2);"><strong>see more</strong></a>
<div id="sentenceBox2">
<p>You would follow this phrase by saying what the topic/subject you are writing to them about (e.g. 'the current problems with York's telephone network', 'the Johnson project' etc...).</p> 
<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'I am writing with regards to next month's marketing presentation in Seattle.'</p>

<a id="seeLess2" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:hidetext(2);"><strong>see less</strong></a> 
</div><!-- /end #sentenceBox2 --> 

<h3 class="sentenceSynonym">With reference to...</h3>
<p class="sentenceSynonymDescrip">This phrase is used when you know or have had contact with the person/people you are writing to before and you are responding/replying to either an email/letter they sent or to something they said or ask you to do (either by phone or face-to-face).</p>
<a id="seeMore3" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:showtext(3);"><strong>see more</strong></a>
<div id="sentenceBox3">
<p>You would follow this phrase by saying what you are responding/replying to (e.g. 'your email', 'our telephone conversation' etc...) and the topic/subject of it (e.g. 'regarding the current problems with York's telephone network', 'regarding the Johnson project' etc...).</p>

<p>After this, you would say what you have done (e.g. ', I have spoken with our sales department' etc...) or introduce the section in the email/letter where you answer their questions (e.g. ', I can confirm the following:'):</p> 
<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'With reference to your email regarding next month's marketing presentation in Seattle, I can confirm the following:'</p>
</div>
<a id="seeLess3" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:hidetext(3);"><strong>see less</strong></a> 
</div><!-- /end #sentenceBox3 -->


<h3 class="sentenceSynonym">Further to...</h3>
<p class="sentenceSynonymDescrip">This is basically the same as 'With reference to', in that it is used when you know or have had contact with the person/people you are writing to before and you are responding/replying to either an email/letter they sent or to something they said or ask you to do (either by phone or face-to-face).</p>
<a id="seeMore4" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:showtext(4);"><strong>see more</strong></a>
<div id="sentenceBox4">
<p>You would follow this phrase by saying what you are responding/replying to (e.g. 'your email', 'our telephone conversation' etc...) and the topic/subject of it (e.g. 'regarding the current problems with York's telephone network', 'regarding the Johnson project' etc...).</p>

<p>After this, you would say what you have done (e.g. ', I have spoken with our sales department' etc...) or introduce the section in the email/letter where you answer their questions (e.g. ', I can confirm the following:'):</p> 
<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'Further to your email regarding next month's marketing presentation in Seattle, I have investigated your concerns with our marketing department.'</p>
</div>
<a id="seeLess4" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:hidetext(4);"><strong>see less</strong></a> 
</div><!-- /end #sentenceBox4 -->


<h3 class="sentenceSynonym">My name is Ruth Smith and I work...</h3>
<p class="sentenceSynonymDescrip">This phrase is used to introduce yourself. It should be used when you have never had any contact with the person you are writing to before. You would use this when you are making the first contact on the topic/subject you are writing to them about, not responding/replying to them.</p>
<a id="seeMore5" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:showtext(5);"><strong>see more</strong></a>
<div id="sentenceBox5">
<p>You should follow this by saying which company/organisation you work for (e.g. 'at Shell International'), the department and company/organisation you work for (e.g. 'in the accounting department at Shell International'), or your job title and the company/organisation you work for (e.g. 'as an accountant at Shell International'). The choice is yours.</p> 
<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'My name is Ruth Smith and I work in the customer services department at HBOS.'</p>
</div>
<p>
You would follow this by explaining what the topic/subject you are writing to them about is. You can use either of the first two phrases on this web page to do this: 'I am writing with regards to....'/'I am writing in reference...':</p>

<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'My name is Ruth Smith and I work in the customer services department at HBOS. I am writing with regards to some issues we have noticed on recent transactions on your credit card.'</p>
</div>
<a id="seeLess5" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:hidetext(5);"><strong>see less</strong></a> 
</div><!-- /end #sentenceBox5 -->


<h3 class="sentenceSynonym">My name is Ruth Smith and I am writing on behalf of...</h3>
<p class="sentenceSynonymDescrip">This is very similar to the previous phrase in that it is used when you have never had any contact with the person before and you're introducing yourself. The difference is that it is used when the person in your company/organisation who normally has contact with the person you are writing to is either unable to write to them (e.g. they are on holiday) or has asked you to do it instead (e.g. they are busy).</p>
<a id="seeMore6" class="moreandlessLinks" href="javascript:showtext(6);"><strong>see more</strong></a>
<div id="sentenceBox6">
<p>You can use this phrase when you are both making the first contact on the topic/subject you are writing to them about or responding/replying to them on something.</p>

<p>You should follow this by saying the name of the person they know and normally have contact with in your company/organisation (e.g. 'William Smith') or with both that person's name and the name of your company/organisation  (e.g. 'William Smith at Shell International'). The choice is yours.</p> 
<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'My name is Peter Clough and I am writing on behalf of William Smith at Shell International.'</p>
</div>
<p>You would follow this by explaining what you are writing to them about. The choice of phrase you use to do this, depends on whether you are responding/replying to something or not. You can use any of the first four phrases on this web page to do this: 'With reference to...'/'Further to...' or 'I am writing with regards to....'/'I am writing in reference...'. </p>
<div class="writingSynonymExample">
<p>'My name is Peter Clough and I am writing on behalf of William Smith at Shell International. With reference to your email regarding next month's marketing presentation in Seattle, I can confirm the following:'</p>
</div>

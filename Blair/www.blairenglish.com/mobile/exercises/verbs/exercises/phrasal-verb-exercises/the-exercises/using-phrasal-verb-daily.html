<p class="openParaArticle">Phrasal verbs are one of the areas of English that most learners hate. But if you learn them in the right way, they aren't really that difficult to understand or use.</p>


<p>That is the reason that I created the videos in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKSU38G4aifIegVMqCbi_A"><strong><u>Phrasal Verb Daily</u></strong></a>, to teach you phrasal verbs in English in a way that'll help you quickly and easily learn them.</p>

<p>Below I'll quickly explain who they are for and how to use the Phrasal Verb Daily videos on YouTube to help you improve your knowledge and use of phrasal verbs.</p> 

<p>I'll then explain a little about the videos and why they will help you.

<h2>Who the videos are for</h2>

<p>Students who have an intermediate (B1) or higher level of English. They are very useful for students studying for FCE, CAE or IELTS exams. For students with lower levels, the videos may be a little too difficult to understand.</p>

<h2>When to watch the videos</h2>

<p>The most effective way to watch these videos (to learn and remember each phrasal verb) is to watch one each day.</p> 

<p>It is no problem to watch two of them in a day, but l would not recommend watching more than two in a day (you won't really remember the phrasal verbs if you do).</p>

<h2>Use the phrasal verb in a sentence after each video</h2>

<p>After you have learnt the meaning of the phrasal verb in the video, make a sentence in your own words where you use it. Doing this is really important for remembering its meaning in the future.</p>

<p>You can either say the sentence or write it down, it's your choice.</p>

<h2>Do the quiz after each 10 videos</h2>

<p>To make really sure you won't forget the phrasal verbs you have learnt in the future, there is a quiz for you to do on this website after each 10 videos.</p>

<p>Each quiz will test you on the 10 phrasal verbs you learnt (e.g. 1 to 10, 11 to 20 etc...). There are two parts to the quiz (the first where you have to put each of the phrasal verbs into a sentence and the second where you match each phrasal verb to its meaning). The quiz will take you 5 to 10 minutes to do.</p>

<p>There will be a link to go to the quiz in the description part and comments section in each tenth video of Phrasal Verb Daily (e.g. video 10, video 20, video 30 etc...)</p>


<p>To find all the quizzes for Phrasal Verb Daily, go to the <a href="../../../../../../exercises/verbs/exercises/phrasal-verb-exercises/phrasal_verb_quizzes_selectionpage.html"><strong><u>Phrasal Verb Quizzes page</u></strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Only one meaning is used in each video</h2>

<p>Many phrasal verbs have more than one meaning (e.g. 'take off', 'work out' etc...). However, even if a phrasal verb does have multiple meanings, in each video in Phrasal Verb Daily I will only give one meaning for it.</p> 

<p>I have found that if I explain all the meanings of a phrasal verb to students at the same time, it causes them to get confused and doesn't help them to learn them.</p>

<p>If a phrasal verb has more than one meaning, I will explain each meaning it has in different videos (for example there will be two different videos for 'put off' and three different videos for 'sort out').</p>

<h2>Which phrasal verbs are used</h2>

<p>Not all phrasal verbs (or their meanings) are difficult to understand. In fact, most of them are easy (e.g. 'sell out'). It is only some of them which learners have difficulties with. And it is these difficult phrasal verbs which you will find used in the videos in Phrasal Verb Daily.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be many phrasal verbs meanings which you will already know and use (e.g. 'wake up' or 'go out'). In the videos in Phrasal Verb Daily you won't find these easy phrasal verbs being used (it is a waste of your time).</p>

<p>The phrasal verb meanings which are used in the videos, are for those phrasal verbs which are both commonly used and which I find many students get confused with or don't know.</p> 


<h2>You have to guess the meaning before I tell you</h2>

<p>In most videos on phrasal verbs on YouTube, you'll find they will tell you the meaning of the phrasal verb before they give you an example of it being used. This is not a good way to learn them and you will not remember their meaning(s) in the future.</p>

<p>In the videos in Phrasal Verb Daily, it is you who has to guess the meaning by using the context of two examples they are in. It is only after these two examples that I'll tell you what the meaning of the phrasal verb is.</p>

<p>By doing this, you'll not only really learn what they mean, but it will also help you to remember them in the future.</p>

<h2>That's it</h2>

<p>Phrasal verbs aren't really that difficult to learn, you just need to know the right way to learn them. By watching the videos in Phrasal Verb Daily and doing what I suggest, you'll find you'll quickly improve your knowledge of them and know how to learn them effectively in the future.</p>

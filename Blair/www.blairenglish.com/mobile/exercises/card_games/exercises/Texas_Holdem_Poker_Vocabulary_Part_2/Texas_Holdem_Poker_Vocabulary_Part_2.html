 <h2>Exercise: How to play Texas Hold'em poker continued</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two friends (Peter and Juan), Peter continue to explain to Juan how to play Texas Hold'em in English.</p>
 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So in the first round of game of Texas Hold'em. After the two players have had to make blind bets (bets that two of the players have to make before any of the players receive their first two cards). What do the rest of the players do when they are all dealt their two private/hole cards?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'All the players have to decide if they want to continue in the game by putting money into the pot or if they want to leave the game, which is called to <strong>fold</strong>. Because two of the players have put money into the pot with the blind bets, the rest of the players have to match the amount put in by the person who has the big blind button in front of them if they want to continue playing (including the player with the small blind button, who has to double the amount they put in at the start of the game).'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Does a <strong>round</strong> happen each time new cards are given to the players or shown in the middle of the table face up?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes. A round is when the players can bet their money or chips in a game. In Texas Hold'em the first round is normally called <strong>the pre-flop</strong>. It begins when the players are given their two hole or private cards.<br><br>The second round begins when the dealer deals the three shared or community cards in the middle of the table. When the first three community cards are dealt. This second round is called <strong>the flop</strong> in Texas Holdem.<br><br>The third round (which is called <strong>the turn</strong>) begins when the dealer adds a fourth community card in the middle of the table. The last round (which is called <strong>the river</strong>) begins when the dealer deals the fifth and last community card on the table.<br><br>After all the players left in the game have put the same amount of chips/money into the pot in 'the river' round, the round ends and they then have to show their cards to see who has won the game.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, I know how the first round starts, after the two players to the left of the player with the dealer button put the blind bets into the pot and all the players receive their first two cards. But which player starts the second round?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In all the rounds except the first it is the first player who is still playing and is sat to the left of the player with the dealer button who starts the round. In the first round, it is player sat to the left of the player with the big blind button who starts the round.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, does the player beginning a round always have to put chips/money into the pot if they want to continue playing?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they don't. If they don't want to put chips/money into the pot, they say <strong>check</strong> and then it goes to the next player. If that player also doesn't want to put chips/money into the pot, they can also say check and then it would go to the next player. But if that player thinks he has a good hand/cards they can decide to put chips/money into the pot. The first time in a round (except in the first round) that a player puts money into the pot is called a <strong>bet</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So if a player makes a bet of $20. What does the next player have to do? Can they say check and not put any chips/money into the pot?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No. When somebody has already put chips/money into the pot, they can't check, they also have to gamble chips/money or fold/leave the game.<br><br>The next player has three options. The first option is that they can fold/leave the game. The second option is to put the same value of money/chips into the pot that the last player has put into the pot. This is called to <strong>call</strong>. So if the last player put $20 in, when you call you also put $20 in.<br><br>The last option is to put more chips/money into the pot than the last player. This is called to <strong>raise</strong>. So if the last player put $20 in, and you raise by $10, you put $30 in.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So when does a round end?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A round ends when all the players who haven't folded and are still playing have put in the same amount/value of chips/money into the pot. So in a game of 4 players, if player 1 checks, player 2 folds, but player 3 makes a bet of $30 and player 4 then raises by $10 the round continues and it goes back to player 1 again. If player 1 wants to continue playing, he/she has to match the $40 that player 4 put in and call (put $40 into the pot).<br><br>It then continues to player 3 again. If player 3 wants to continue playing, he/she has to match the $40 of player 4 by calling and adding another €10 to the pot. The round will then finish because all the remaining players have each put $40 into the pot.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A little bit confusing, but it makes sense. I've seen people in the movies playing poker and they don't say call or raise or bet, but say all-in. What does that mean?'
 </span></p>
 

 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's very common in films with poker games. The phrase <strong>all-in</strong> means that a player in a round puts all of his or her chips they have on the table in front of them (called his or her 'table stakes') into the pot.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok, but what happens if one of the players has put $120 into the pot in a round and  one of the other players only has $100 of chips on the table. They would have to fold/leave the game in that round because they don't have the chips/money to match what has been put into the pot in that round?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No they don't have to fold. If the player has a good hand and thinks that they could win the game, they could go all-in in the round.'
 </span></p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But you said that all players have to put the same amount of money into the pot to continue playing in the game? If one of the players has put $120 into the pot and one of the other players has gone all-in and only put $100 in, it doesn't seem fair to the player who has put the extra $20 in!'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In that situation, if these are the only two players left in the game, the player who has put $20 extra into the pot, removes it and then the dealer deals the remaining community cards and then each player shows their hands to the dealer and to the other players to see who has won.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But what happens if there are more than two players left when somebody goes all-in? Do all the players have to remove the extra chips/money they have put into the pot?'
 </span></p>
 

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It gets a little complicated now. If there are more than two players left in a game when one of the players goes all-in, the chips/money is separated into two different pots (the main pot and the side pot) so the poker game can continue if the other players want to put more chips/money into the game.<br><br>For example, imagine there are three players left in a poker game. At the start of the third round, player 1 bets $50, player 2 only has $40 left, so he goes all-in with his/her $40. Player 3 raises by €10, so puts $60 into the pot. The round returns to player 1, who calls, so matches the $60 of player 3 by adding $10 to his/her original $50.<br><br>To make it fair for all the players, $40 from each player is put into what is called the <strong>main pot</strong>. All three players could win this main pot. The extra money ($20 each) which has been put into the game by players 1 and 3 is put into another pot which can only be won by them two (not player 2). This is called a <strong>side pot</strong> and this is where all the chips/money will be placed in the next round until the game finishes.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So when all three players show their cards at the end of the game, which is called <strong>the showdown</strong>, if player 1 has three number 7s, player 2 has four Queens and player 3 has two number 10s. Player 2 will win the chips/money in the main pot, but who wins the chips/money in the side pot?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Player 1 will win the chips/money in the side pot because his hand is better than Player 3's hand.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That makes sense.'
 </span></p>

  <p><strong>Round:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> It is also called a 'betting round'. A 'round' is when each player gambles/bets their money (also known as 'to put money/chips into the pot') or leave the game (which is called 'fold' in poker).<br><br> In a Texas Hold'em poker game there are normally four different 'rounds'. Each 'round' begins after each time new cards are dealt by the dealer to all the players or in the middle of the poker table. A 'round' ends when all the players who are still in the game have gambled/put into the pot the same amount money. After each 'round' has finished (except the last 'round'), a new card or new cards are dealt by the dealer. After the 'last round' has finished, the players show their cards in the 'showdown' to find the winner of the game.<br><br>  In Texas Hold'em each round has its own name. The 'first round' (after each player receives their two private/hole cards) is called the 'pre-flop'. The 'second round' (after the dealer deals the first three community cards in the middle of the table) is called the 'flop'. The 'third round' (after the dealer deals a fourth community cards in the middle of the table) is called the 'turn'. And the 'last round' (after the dealer deals a fifth community cards in the middle of the table) is called the 'river'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"ronda"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>The showdown:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> It happens at the end of the game when the players still playing show their cards to see who has the best hand/set of cards. The player with the best hand (a combination of a player's two hole/private cards and three of the five community/shared cards) wins the game and all the money/chips which has been gambled/put into the pot.<br><br>  In theory in 'the showdown', the first player to show their hole/private cards and say what their hand is (e.g. '2 pair', ' 2 queens'), is the first player still playing sat to the left of the player who has the 'dealer button'. The next player to show their cards/hand is sat to the left of this first player and so on.<br><br>  If after the first player has shown their cards, the next player sees that the first player's hand/cards are better and they have lost, it is normal for them to not show their cards and give them back to the dealer unseen (this is called 'to muck'). 'the showdown' finishes when all the remaining players have either shown or mucked their cards and the money/pot is given to the winner(s).<br><br>  In Spanish: <em><b>"la muestra de cartas"</b></em>.</p>

   <p><strong>Call:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to call'. When a player says 'call' in a round of a game of poker, it basically means 'I'm going to gamble/put into pot the same amount of chips/money that the last player has gambled/put in'. For example, player 1 bets $25, player 2 'calls' and player 3 also 'calls'. In this example, all three players gamble/put into the pot $25 each.<br><br>  The main rule in poker is that if players want to continue to the end of a game, they all have to gamble/put into the pot the same amount of chips/money. So, if in the above example there is another player (player 4) and that player decides that he or she wants to 'raise'/increase the amount gambled/put into the pot to $35, then the round returns back to player 1 who has to match the $35. In this situation, if player 1 says 'call' he or she only has to put another $10 into the pot because they have already put $25 in before (this matches the $35 that player 4 has put in).<br><br>  Once all the players still playing have put the same amount of money/chips into the pot, the round ends. If a player wants to 'call' on their turn in a round, they simply say 'call' and say nothing else.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"ir"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Raise:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> This means to 'increase' the amount of money/chips which is being gambled/put into the pot in a round of a game of poker. A player can only 'raise' in a round after a player before him/her has first put money/chips into the pot (which is called 'bet' in poker).<br><br>  In poker, when you 'raise' you can say it in two ways. The first, is where you say how much in total you are going to gamble/put into the pot by saying 'raise' followed by the preposition 'to' and then the quantity of the money, e.g. 'raise to $35'. The second way, is to say how much extra money you are going to gamble/put into pot in the round than what the player(s) before you have gambled/put in, by saying 'raise' followed by the preposition 'by' and then the quantity/value of the extra money you are gambling. For example, player 1 opens a round and bets $25, then player 2 'raises by' $10 (player 2 gambles/puts into the pot a total of $35). If the other players want to continue in the game they have to at least put the same amount of money/chips which has been gambled/put in by the player who has last 'raised'.<br><br> In some poker games there is a restriction/limit on the total number of 'raises' that can be made in each round (a limit of 3 or 4 'raises' is common) and/or the amount each 'raise' can be (e.g. a maximum of $20). If a player 'raises' more than once in a round, this is called a 're-raise'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"subir/envidar"</b></em>.</p>

They can't ask for more chips or use more money than they have on the table during a game.<br><br> 'all-in' is used by players in this situation. It means that they can continue in the game being played and are able to show their hand/cards at the end of the game and possibly win the money/chips in the pot. But the player who has gone 'all-in' can not win any extra chips/money that the other players have gambled/put into the pot during the game.<br><br> To make the game fair for all the players, once a player(s) goes 'all-in', any extra money that the other players gamble/put into is kept separate from the pot (which to avoid confusion becomes called the 'main pot') and put into what is called a 'side pot'. All the players (including the player(s) who has gone 'all-in') can win the 'main pot', but only the players who have gambled/put in extra money can win the 'side pot'.<br><br> For example, player 1 bets $200, player 2 only has $150 left and goes 'all-in' with that $150, player 3 calls and puts in $200. The 'main pot' would be $450 ($150 from each of the players). The extra money that players 1 and 3 have put in ($50 each) is put into a 'side pot', which would have $100 in it.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"jugarlo todo/restarse"</b></em>.</p>

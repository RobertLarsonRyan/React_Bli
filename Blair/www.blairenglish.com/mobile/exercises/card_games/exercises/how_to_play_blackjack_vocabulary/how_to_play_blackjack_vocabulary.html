<p class="openParaArticle">Blackjack is one of the most popular card game that is played in the world. In blackjack, each card has a point value (e.g. a King is 10 points, an Ace is 1 or 11 points, a 7 is 7 points etc...). If a player's cards score more points than the dealer's cards (it must be 21 points or below) they win and get money.</p> <p>Although blackjack is a simple game, there is some vocabulary and rules which are used that can make it a little confusing.</p> 

<p>And in this online exercise on blackjack vocabulary, you'll learn and remember the English vocabulary which you need to understand to play a game of blackjack (first by reading a text and then doing a quiz).</p>

 <h2>Exercise: How to play blackjack</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two friends (Peter and Juan), Peter is explaining to Juan how to play blackjack and its terminology in English.</p>
 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to make sure that you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Are you looking forward to going to the casino tonight?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, I like playing blackjack. The problem is that I've only ever been to a casino where they speak Spanish before. I know how to play the game, but I don't know what the vocabulary is when playing in English. For example, I know that the person who gives the players cards, is called the dealer. But what do you call it when a dealer gives the players cards at the beginning of a game?'
 </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In card games, you don't say the dealer gives cards to the players, you say the dealer <strong>deals</strong> cards to the players. You know that in blackjack you aren't playing against the cards of the other players at the table, but against the <strong>house</strong>? Which means against the casino, the cards of the dealer who works for the casino.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah, and if there are three players with a better <strong>hand</strong> (which means better cards) than the dealer at the end of the game. Then all three players win.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. Now, I'll explain what happens in a game of blackjack. The game starts when the players place or put their <strong>bet</strong> in front of themselves on the table. The bet is how many chips/money they want to gamble in that game of blackjack. In most games of blackjack there is a minimum amount of money/chips the players have to give if they want to play, this is called a minimum bet (e.g. $10). If you win, the casino will give you double the amount of money/chips you bet.<br><br>After the players have placed their bets, the dealer deals two cards to all the players and him/herself. All the cards to the players are dealt face up (so both the others players and the dealer can see them). The first dealer's card is dealt face up, but the dealer's second card is dealt face down and is only shown at the end of the game when it's the dealer turn. This second card is called a hole card, because none of the other players can see what it is.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What happens if I have 21 points with the first two cards?'
 </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If you have a hand which is 21 points with your first two cards (e.g. an Ace and a 10), it is a called a <strong>blackjack</strong> and you automatically win and the casino gives you double the amount you bet, plus an additional 50 per cent for having a blackjack (e.g. if your bet was $10, you will receive $25).'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, if I have a hand which is 19 points (e.g. a Jack and a 9). What do I say to not receive any more cards?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When it's your turn, you say <strong>stand</strong> and you won't get any more cards dealt to you. But if your first two cards only had a value of 12 points (e.g. an 8 and a 4), you would want the dealer to deal you another card. To get another card, you say <strong>hit</strong> when it's your turn. If you were happy with this extra card and didn't want another, you would then say stand to the dealer.<br><br>But you have to be careful when you hit/receive another card because if the total number of points of your hand/cards is above 21, then you go <strong>bust</strong> and you are out of the game and lose the money you've bet.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If my first two cards are not good, is there a way I can leave the game and not lose the money that I bet when the game/hand started?'
 </span></p>
 


 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, there isn't. But if after you have received your first two cards, you say <strong>surrender</strong>, you can leave the game and only lose half of the money you have bet. Also in blackjack there is a way to bet your chips/money on the dealer to win the game with a blackjack (21 points in two cards). If the dealer's card that is face up (you can see it) is an Ace, the dealer will ask if any of players want <strong>insurance</strong>, to bet their money that the dealer's other card that is face down is a card with a value of 10 points. If you take insurance and the dealer has a blackjack, you double the money you bet as insurance.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'If my first two cards are very good (e.g. have a value of 19 or 20 points), is there a way to add more money/chips to my original bet.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'There is only one way to increase your original bet when you already have your first two cards. You can double your bet. But if you do, the dealer has to deal/give you an extra card and after that card you can't hit/ask for any more cards. This is called <strong>double</strong> or doubling down.<br><br>Normally, players only double if their two cards have a total of 11 or 10 points (because there is a high chance/probability that the extra card will be worth 10 points). You wouldn't double if your two cards had 17 points, because there is a high chance you will go bust (go over 21 points) with the extra card.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I have seen players who start to play with one hand and separate the two cards and play in the game with two hands. How can they do that?'
 </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When a player's first two cards in their hand are of the same type (e.g. two aces, two queens, two 9s etc...), they have the option to separate the two cards and play two hands/sets of cards in the game. This is called to <strong>split</strong>. But when you do this, you have to bet on the new hand you have created (you double the amount of money you are betting in the game).'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What if your hand draws with the dealer's hand? The number of points you have in your hand/cards is the same as the hand/cards of the dealer at the end of the game. Does the dealer win?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they don't. Neither of you win or lose. In blackjack, this is called a <strong>push</strong> and you get your original bet back.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I saw a film on television where there was a game of blackjack and they said something that a hand/set of cards was a hard 17 and another hand/set of cards was a soft 17. What's the difference?'
 </span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In a game of blackjack, all the cards have a fixed value/number of points (e.g. a King is 10 points, a 7 is 7 points etc...) except for the Aces. The Aces in blackjack can be worth either 1 point or 11 points and the player can decide which. A <strong>soft</strong> 17 is where a hand/set of cards has total value of 17 points and includes an Ace which is being used with a value of 11 points (e.g. 'an Ace and a 5' is a soft 16), because the player can change the value of the Ace to 1 point if they want to.<br><br>If the hand/set of cards has a total of 17 points and doesn't include an Ace or if the Ace's value can only be 1 point (because the player's hand would bust/be over 21 points if the Ace was used with 11 points), it is called a <strong>hard</strong> 17 (e.g. 'a King and a 6' is a hard 16 and also 'an Ace, a 5 and a Jack' is a hard 16).'

  <p><strong>Hand:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'hand' has two different meanings in blackjack (and in other card games too). The first meaning of 'hand' in blackjack is the set of cards that a player or dealer has to play with in a game. A player's 'hand' is the two cards that the dealer gives him or her at the beginning of the game, plus any more cards the player asks for in the game (e.g. when a player says 'hit' or when they say 'double'). At the end of a game, if the player's 'hand' is better than the dealer's 'hand', the player wins and doubles their money.<br><br> The second meaning of 'hand' in blackjack is one game of blackjack. It is common to hear people say 'wait until the hand has finished' or 'who won the last hand?'. This can be confusing for non-native speakers of English.<br><br> The only way to know which meaning of 'hand' is being used is from the context. This will help you decide whether they mean a 'player's cards' or a 'game'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"mano/cartas"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Soft:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> A 'soft' hand in blackjack is where the value of a hand/set of cards of the dealer or players is made by using an Ace with a value of 11 point. For example, a hand with an Ace and a 6 is called a 'soft 17'. It is called 'soft' because the value of of the Ace could also be 1 point if the player/dealer wanted it to be (and the hand would be worth 7 points instead of 17).<br><br> For people playing blackjack, the only reason why they need to know what a 'soft' hand is, is because normally in casino/online blackjack there is a rule written on the blackjack table that says 'the dealer must draw on soft 17'. This means if the dealer's hand is 17 points and it includes an Ace which is used with a value of 11 points, the dealer has to give/deal himself/herself at least one more card.<br><br> If a hand/set of cards doesn't include an Ace or if it does, but the Ace's value can only be 1 point, it is called a 'hard' or just the number of points is used. For example, a hand with a Queen and a 6 or a hand with an Ace, a 5 and a Jack is called 'hard' 16 or just 16.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"suave/blando"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Blackjack:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'blackjack' or a 'natural' is the name used when a player or a dealer gets 21 points in their first two cards. A 'blackjack' or 'natural' is a combination of an Ace with a card that has a value of 10 points (e.g. a King, a Queen, a Jack or a number 10). This is the best hand/set of cards you can have in blackjack and beats any other hand (including having 21 points from 3 cards).<br><br> In most casinos and online games (but not in all), if a player's hand is a 'blackjack' and the dealer doesn't also have a 'blackjack', the player receives 50% more winnings than if they won by another hand/set of cards (e.g. 19 points, 18 points or 21 points from 3 cards). If a casino pays 50% extra winnings for a 'blackjack' is will be written on the blackjack table like this, 'Blackjack pays 3 to 2'. If it says on the blackjack table 'Blackjack pays even money', there is no extra winnings.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"blackjack"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Hard:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> A 'hard' hand in blackjack is where a player's or dealer's hand/set of cards doesn't include an Ace or if it does, the Ace's value can only be 1 point. In blackjack, an Ace can have two different values, 11 points or 1 point. It is the player's or dealer's decision what the value of the ace is in their hand. But if they have three or more cards with an Ace being one of them and if they would go 'bust' (go over 21 points and out of the game) if they use the Ace for 11 points, this is when a hand with an ace is called 'hard' (because the player/dealer can only use the Ace with a value of 1 point). For example, a hand with a Queen and a 6 or a hand with an Ace, a 5 and a Jack is called a 'hard 17'.<br><br> Normally in blackjack, they don't use 'hard', they just say the number. So, in the last example although the hand is a 'hard 17', dealers and players would just call it a '17'.<br><br> The opposite of a 'hard' hand is called a 'soft' hand and this is where the value of a hand/set of cards of the dealer/players is made by using an Ace with a value of 11 points. For example, a hand with an Ace and a 6 is called a 'soft 17'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"duro"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Double:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to double'. This is also called 'doubling down'. Basically, it means to 'double' (increase by 2) your original bet. This is really the only way in a game of blackjack a player can increase the amount of the original bet on their hand/set of cards. Players can 'double'/'double down' after they have been dealt their cards by the dealer. The only problem is that if a player says 'double'/'double down' they are automatically dealt one extra card (they can't receive any more cards after this) that is placed horizontal to the rest of the cards (to help the dealer remember that the player has 'doubled'/'doubled down'). So normally the only players who 'double'/'double down' are those whose first two cards have a total value of 9 or 10 points.<br><br> If a player wants to 'double' on their turn, they either say 'double' or 'double down' or signal to the dealer by pointing at the table with one finger and moving more chips next to their original bet chips.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"doblar"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Surrender:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to surrender'. In some blackjack games/tables the players have the option to leave the game after they have received and seen their first two cards. This is called to 'surrender'. Normally, this happens when a player thinks that his/her hand is bad and that the dealer has the possibility of having a very good hand (the dealer's visible card is an ace or a 10 point card).<br><br> When a player 'surrenders', they will lose half of the money/chips that he or she made in the original bet at the beginning of the game. A player can not 'surrender' after they have 'hit'/asked for another card. If you want to know if you can 'surrender' in a blackjack game, you should ask the dealer.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"rendirse"</b></em>.</p>

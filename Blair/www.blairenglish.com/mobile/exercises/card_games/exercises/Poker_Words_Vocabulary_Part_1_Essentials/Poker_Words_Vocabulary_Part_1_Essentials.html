   <p class="openParaArticle">Playing poker is becoming a very popular sport/game. In the past you could only play it in either a casino or with friends, but now it is possible to play it 24 hours a day from your home on the internet. Although poker is a simple game, it has a terminology and rules which are used that can make it a little confusing (especially if the poker game is in English and you are a non-native speaker).</p> 
<p>In this first part of two online exercises on 'poker vocabulary', you will learn some of the basic/essential English vocabulary used in poker and what it means. This exercise doesn't focus on the vocabulary that is used to play an actual game of poker (which is covered in the online exercise '<a href="../../../../../exercises/card_games/exercises/Poker_Words_Vocabulary_Part_2_How_To_Play_A_Poker_Game/Poker_Words_Vocabulary_Part_2_How_To_Play_A_Poker_Game.html"><b>English vocabulary for poker exercise part 2</b></a>') but on the terminology connected to poker in general. Have a quick read of the exercise below and if it seems too easy for you, I would recommend you go directly to the second part of the exercise.</p> <p>Although this exercise focuses on the most commonly played type of poker 'Texas Hold'em' (where the players each hold/have 2 cards and 5 cards are laid/put down in the middle of the table for all the players to see), these terms can also be used for other types of poker as well.</p>

<div id="exercise_content">

 <p>In the following conversation between two friends (Peter and Juan), Peter is explaining to Juan some things that he needs to know to play poker in English.</p>
 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, are you coming to the casino tonight to play Texas Hold'em poker?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I suppose so. But I think I'll just watch you guys play. I have gambled before in casinos, but I've only gambled my money in games of roulette and blackjack. I have no idea how to play poker.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's not difficult to play. I'm sure you've seen people play it in films.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I understand the game, each player bets or <strong>gambles</strong> their own money in the game. The last player left or the player with the best cards wins all the money that all the players have gambled/spent on the game. But I have no ideas about what to say or what to do when I'm playing.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'll explain it to you. You play poker to win the <strong>pot</strong>. The pot is the name for all money that the players bet or gamble during one game of poker. In poker, when a player gambles their money, they say the player <strong>puts in</strong> money or puts money into the pot.<br><br>The size of the pot increases during a game as players gamble/put in more money. The person who wins the pot is the person who is still playing in the game at the end and has the best cards, which is called the best <strong>hand</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I understand if your hand is four kings, it is better than if somebody else's hand is three 10s. But how many cards will I get to play with? 5 or 7?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In Texas Hold'em, they <strong>deal</strong> or give to each player two cards. These cards are dealt <strong>face down</strong> to each player, so none of the other players can see what type or number the cards are. These are called a player's hole cards.<br><br>Then during the poker game another 5 cards are dealt, but this time in the middle of the poker table and this time they are dealt <strong>face up</strong>, so all the players can see what type or number they are.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Who deals the cards? Is it another player?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When you're playing at home, yes. But in a casino, the person who deals the cards is called the <strong>dealer</strong>. He or she works for the casino and normally doesn't play poker in the game.'
 </span></p>
 
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok. So how do you start to play?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, before you can play poker in a casino you have to convert your money into <strong>chips</strong>. These are small plastic circles/discs of different colours. Each colour represents a different amount of money (For example, a red chip represents $5).<br><br>When you have converted your money into chips, you go to a poker table where there is a seat available and wait until the current game finishes. You can also buy chips at the poker tables.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Is that it to join a game?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No. In a lot of large casinos, you can't just go to a poker table and sit down and start playing. In these casinos there is a waiting list to join the poker tables. You have to <strong>put your name down</strong> on this waiting list and wait until all the people in front of you on the list have joined a game. When it's your turn, they will call your name and tell you which poker table you're playing at.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok, that makes sense.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Also, to join most poker games you need to have a minimum amount of chips with you to join the game. This can be anything from $40 to $10,000 or more, it depends on the poker game. This is called a <strong>buy-in</strong>. Often a poker game on a poker table will have a buy-in of $40 to $100 to join.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Do you have any advice on choosing which poker table to join?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Because you are new to playing you should look to see what the minimum amount of money that a player can put into to the pot during a game is. This is called the <strong>minimum bet</strong>. This can be anything from $2 to over a $100. You should look for a poker table with a very low minimum bet, so you don't lose too much money when you're playing.'

But there is also a high probability/risk that you will lose the money that you have spent or 'gambled'. In poker in casinos, you have to 'gamble' your money to play.<br><br> A verb with the same meaning is 'to bet'. But whereas 'gamble' is normally used to talk about spending money in games of chance in general (e.g. 'he gambles a lot in casinos, mainly in poker'), 'to bet' is normally used to talk about spending money on a specific game/occasion (e.g. 'he bet $450 in the last game of poker' or 'I want to bet €20 on Leeds United to win against Manchester United').<br><br> The noun of 'gamble' is 'gambling' and means the activity of spending money on these types of things, e.g. 'she likes gambling'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"jugar/apostar"</b></em>.</p>

You have to go first to an employee of the casino (called the 'board attendant') and tell him or her what type of poker you want to play (type and how much the minimum and/or maximum bets are). If there is a seat/space available at a poker table, the board attendant will send you to that table. If there isn't, you will have to wait until a seat is available.<br><br> You have to 'put your name down' on the waiting list, which means give the board assistant your name (although normally you just give your initials (e.g. the initials for Simon Parker are SP)) and tell them what type of poker you want to play, e.g. 'can I put my name down for Texas Hold'em' 'yes' 'it's Simon Parker'. Your name/initials will then be put on a big white or electronic board and you will have to wait and watch the board. When a seat is available, the board attendant will call you and tell you which poker table to go to.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"poner/inscribir/apuntar un nombre en una lista"</b></em>.</p>

But, people also use 'pot' in poker with the meaning of 'the total amount of money/chips which is gambled/bet by the players during one game', e.g. 'what's the pot now?' '$643'. In a game of poker, if players want to continue to be in the game they normally have to continue to 'put more money/chips into the 'pot' (which means to gamble/bet more of their own money/chips).<br><br> 'pot' is also used with the same meaning in the card game called 'baccarat'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"pozo/bote"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Minimum bet:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> In most poker games they have a rule about what is the lowest/minimum amount of money which can be gambled or bet by each player during one round of poker (a round is each time a new card or cards are dealt and there are normally 3 or 4 rounds in one game of poker). This is called the 'minimum bet'.<br><br> The 'minimum bet' in a poker game can be from $2 to $1,000 or even more. It is common in poker games in casinos for the 'minimum bet' to increase in the last two rounds of a game of poker. Normally, in casinos they tell the players before they start playing what the 'minimum bet(s)' are. For example, if you see $4/$8 written next to the name of a poker table, it means the 'minimum bet' for the first two rounds is $4 and for the last two rounds it is $8.<br><br> All types of casino games have a 'minimum bet'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"apuesta mínima"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Puts in:</strong><br><em>(phrasal verb)</em> The infinitive is 'to put in'. In this context it means to 'gamble' money in a poker or some other card game (but is not used in other casino games like roulette). 'to put in' is used to tell people how much money/chips a player has 'gambled'. For example, 'player 2 has put in $235 in the last round'. 'put in' is more commonly used in poker games than 'gamble'. This phrasal verb is normally followed by an amount/quantity of money (e.g. £50, $85 etc...), e.g. 'she just put in €45'.<br><br> A phrase which has the same meaning and is only used in poker is 'to put into the pot'. The amount/quantity of money is placed in this phrase between 'put' and 'into'. For example, 'she just put €45 into the pot'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"poner"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Hand:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'hand' has two different meanings in poker (and in other card games too). The first meaning of 'hand' in poker is the set of cards that a player has to play with in a game of poker. At the end of a game, the player with the best 'hand' or five cards wins the game. For example, if player one's 'hand' is three queens, a 10 and a 5 (called 3 of a kind) and player two's 'hand' is 2 kings, a jack, a 10 and a 7, player one wins because his 'hand' (cards) is better.<br><br> The second meaning of 'hand' in poker is one game of poker. It is common to hear people say 'wait until the hand has finished' or 'who won the last hand?'. This can be confusing for non-native speakers of English. The only way to know which meaning of 'hand' is being used is from the context. This will help you to decide whether they mean a 'player's cards' or a 'game'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"mano/cartas"</b></em>.</p>

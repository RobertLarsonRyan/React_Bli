<p class="openParaArticle">Playing poker is becoming a very popular sport/game. In the past you could only play in either a casino or with friends, but now, it is possible to play it 24 hours a day from your home on the internet. Although poker is a simple game, it has a terminology and rules which are used that can make it a little confusing (especially if the poker game is in English and you are a non-native speaker).</p> 
<p>In this second of two online exercises on 'poker vocabulary', you will learn and remember the English vocabulary used when actually playing in a game of poker against other players. Although the vocabulary in this exercise is for the most commonly played type of poker 'Texas Hold'em' (where the players each hold/have 2 cards and 5 cards are laid/put down in the middle of the table for all the players to see), these terms can also be used for other types of poker as well.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Playing poker continued</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between two friends (Peter and Juan), Peter continues to explain to Juan how to play in a poker game in English and the terminology that is used.</p>
 
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So what should I say and do when I'm playing in a poker game?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In some types of poker before the dealer gives the players their cards, all the players who are going to play in the game have to put some money into the pot for the game. This is called the <strong>ante</strong> and is normally a small amount of money.<br><br>In Texas Hold'em poker, they don't use an ante, but two of the players in a game have to put a small amount of chips/money into the pot before they and the rest of the players receive their cards. This is called a <strong>blind bet</strong>. The rest of the players in the game don't put anything into the pot before they have their cards.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Ok. So, what happens when the players have their cards?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The first round of the poker game starts when the players have their cards. When they have looked at their cards, they have to decide if they want to continue in the game by putting money into the pot or if they want to leave the game, which is called <strong>fold</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Does a <strong>round</strong> happen each time new cards are given/dealt to the players or shown in the middle of the table face up?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes. In Texas Hold'em for example, the first round begins when all the players are dealt/given their own two hole or private cards. The second round begins when the dealer deals the three shared or community cards in the middle of the table. The third round begins when the dealer adds a fourth shared card in the middle of the table. And the last round begins when the dealer deals the fifth and last shared card onto the table.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, does the player beginning a round always have to put chips/money into the pot if they want to continue playing?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they don't. The player who has the first <strong>turn</strong> at the beginning of a round doesn't have to put chips/money into the pot (the combined money/chips from the all players which is gambled in a game) if they don't want to. If they decide not to, they say <strong>check</strong> and their turn ends and then it's the turn of the player sat to their left to decide what they want to do.<br><br>If that player also doesn't want to put chips/money into the pot, they can also say check and then it would go to the next player. But if that player thinks they have a good hand/cards they can decide to put chips/money into the pot. The first time in a round that a player puts money into the pot is called a <strong>bet</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So if a player makes a bet of $20. What does the next player have to do? Can they say check and not put any chips/money into the pot?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No. When somebody has already put chips/money into the pot, the next player can't check, they also have to put chips/money into the pot or fold/leave the game. The next player has three options: The first option is they can fold/leave the game. The second option is to put the same value of money/chips into the pot that the last player has put into the pot. This is called <strong>call</strong>. So if the last player put $20 in, when you call you put $20 into the pot also.<br><br>The last option is to put more chips/money into the pot than the last player. This is called a <strong>raise</strong>. So if the last player put $20 in, and you say raise by $10, you put $30 in.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So when does a round end?'
 </span></p>
 

 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A round ends when all the players who haven't folded and are still playing have put in the same amount/value of chips/money into the pot. So in a game of four players, if player one checks, player two folds, but player three makes a bet of $30 and player four then raises by $10 the round goes back to player one again. If player 1 wants to continue playing, he/she has to match the $40 that player four put in and call (put $40 into the pot).<br><br>It then continues to player three again. If player three wants to continue playing, he/she has to match the $40 of player three by calling and adding another €10 (to the €30 he/she originally put in) into the pot. The round will then finish because all the remaining players have each put $40 into the pot.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A little bit confusing, but it makes sense. I've seen people in the movies playing poker and they don't say call or raise or bet, but all-in. What does that mean?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's very common in films with poker games. The phrase <strong>all-in</strong> means that a player in a round puts all of his or her chips they have on the table in front of them into the pot.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And what would I say if when I'm playing at a poker table and I decide not to play one game/hand before it had started and just watch the other players playing or go to the toilet?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When you decide not to play in a game before the game starts, is called to <strong>sit out</strong>. You have to tell the dealer that you want to sit out and they won't deal you any cards in that game.'
 </span></p>
 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I've heard that some poker games are fixed limit and others are no limit. What exactly do these mean?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A <strong>fixed limit</strong> game of poker is where there is a restriction on what both the minimum bet is and by how much money players can increase or raise in the game. For example, in a casino you may see a fixed limit poker game, where for the first two rounds the fixed limit is $2. That means that the the minimum bet the players can make is $2. And if one player wants to increase or raise the amount of money put into the pot, they can only increase or raise by $2.<br><br>So if the last player put $2 into the pot, the player can only raise by $2 and put a total of $4 into the put. If the next player raises, they can again only raise by $2, but because the last player put a total of $4 into the pot, he/she will have to put a total of $6 into the pot.<br><br>Normally, in fixed limit games you can only raise 3 or 4 times per round. Normally in casino fixed limit games, the limit you can bet or raise by increases in the last two rounds. For example, in a $2/$4 fixed limit game, the limit for the first two rounds is $2 and in the last two rounds the bet or raise increases to $4.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And I suppose that with a <strong>no limit</strong> game, there isn't any limit on how much money/chips that you can bet or raise in a game?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right.'
 </span></p>

  <p><strong>Round:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> It is also called a 'betting round'. A 'round' is when each player gambles/bets their money (also known as 'to put money/chips into the pot') or leave the game (which is called 'fold' in poker). In a game of poker there are normally four or five different 'rounds'. Each 'round' begins after each time new cards are dealt by the dealer to all the players individually or dealt in the middle of the poker table. A 'round' ends when all the players who are still in the game have gambled/put into the pot the same amount money. After each 'round' has finished (except the last 'round'), new cards are dealt by the dealer.<br><br> After the 'last round' has finished, the players show their cards to find the winner of the game. In some types of poker, the 'rounds' have names. For example, in Texas Hold'em the 'first round' is called the 'pre-flop'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"ronda"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Raise:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> This means to 'increase' the amount of money/chips which is being gambled/put into the pot in a round of a game of poker. A player can only 'raise' in a round after a player before him/her has first put money/chips into the pot (which is called 'bet' in poker).<br><br> In poker, when you 'raise' you can say it in two different  ways. The first, is where you say how much in total you are going to gamble/put into the pot by saying 'raise' followed by the preposition 'to' and then the quantity of the money, e.g. 'raise to $35'.<br><br> The second way, is to say how much extra money you are going to gamble/put into pot in the round than what the player(s) before you have gambled/put in, by saying 'raise' followed by the preposition 'by' and then the quantity/value of the extra money you are gambling (e.g. 'I raise by $10'). For example, player one opens a round and bets $25, then player two 'raises by' $10 (player two gambles/puts into the pot a total $35).<br><br> If the other players want to continue in the game they have to at least put the same amount of money/chips which has been gambled/put in by the player who has last 'raised'. In some poker games there is a restriction/limit on the total number of 'raises' that can be made in each round (a limit of 3 or 4 'raises' is common) and/or the amount each 'raise' can be (e.g. a maximum of $20). If a player 'raises' more than once in a round, this called a 're-raise'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"subir/envidar"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Fixed limit:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'fixed limit' poker is common in casinos. It is used to make a poker game more competitive for all the players. In games where there is no limit to the maximum that a player can raise/increase during a round (called 'no limit' poker), if a player has a lot more chips/money on the table than the other players, he/she can increase/raise so much more that the other players that they don't want to or can't match/equal it ('match/equal' is called 'call' in poker) and have to leave the game or hand (which is called 'fold' in poker). 'fixed limit' poker stops this from happening and it allows players to choose a poker game which is suitable for the amount of money they want to gamble.<br><br> With 'fixed limit', there is both a minimum bet that players can make in each round (e.g. $2 or $8 or $100 etc...) and a maximum bet and increase/raise which is often the same as the minimum bet. Often, the value of the minimum/maximum bet and raise will double in the last two rounds of a poker game (e.g. in a 'fixed limit' $6/$12 game, it doubles to $12 in the last two rounds).<br><br> There is also normally a restriction/limit on the total number of 'raises' that can be made in each round (a limit of 3 or 4 'raises' is common). The dealer and/or casino board attendant will tell you if the poker game is 'fixed limit' and what the minimum and maximum bets and raises are.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"límite fijo"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Turn:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> 'turn' has many different meanings. In this context it means the 'time' in a round/betting round when a player decides in front of the other players and the dealer what they are going to do in the game. During a player's 'turn' they can 'check' or 'call' or 'raise' etc... When they have said what they are going to do (e.g. 'I raise by $20'), their 'turn' ends and it is the next player's 'turn'. In poker, you have to wait your 'turn' before you tell the dealer and the other players what you are going to do.<br><br> In any type of games or sports, a 'turn' is also commonly called a 'go', so you may hear either used, e.g. 'it's your go/turn'.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"toca"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>All-in:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> To go 'all-in' means to gamble/put into the pot all the money/chips you have left on the table. The main rule in poker is that if players want to continue to the end of a game, they all have to gamble/put into the pot the same amount of chips/money. But what happens if a player(s) has a good hand/set of cards but doesn't have enough chips/money left on the table to match (which is called to 'call' in poker) the amount of chips/money that a player before them in the round has gambled/put in? They can't ask for more chips or use more money than they have on the table during a game (which is called their 'table stakes').<br><br> 'all-in' is used by players in this situation. It means that they can continue in the game being played and are able to show their hand/cards at the end of the game and possibiliy win money/chips. But the player who has gone 'all-in' can not win any extra chips/money that the other players have gambled/put into pot during the game.<br><br> To make the game fair for all the players, once a player(s) goes 'all-in', any extra money that the other players gamble/put into is kept separate from the pot (which to avoid confusion becomes called the 'main pot') and put into what is called a 'side pot'. All the players (including the player(s) who has gone 'all-in') can win the 'main pot', but only the players who have gambled/put in extra money can win the 'side pot'.<br><br> For example, player 1 bets $200, player 2 only has $150 left and goes 'all-in' with his/her $150, player 3 calls and puts in $200. The 'main pot' would be $450 ($150 from each of the players). The extra money that players 1 and 3 have put in ($50 each) is put into a 'side pot', which would have $100 in it.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"jugarlo todo/restarse"</b></em>.</p>

For example, player 1 bets $25 (the first time money is gambled in a round is called a 'bet'), player 2 'calls' and player 3 also 'calls'. In this example, all three players gamble/put into the pot $25 each.<br><br> The main rule in poker is that if players want to continue to the end of a game, they all have to gamble/put into the pot the same amount of chips/money. So, if in the above example there is another player (player 4) and that player decides that he or she wants to 'raise'/increase the amount gambled/put into the pot to $35, then the round returns back to player 1 who has to match the $35. In this situation, if player 1 says 'call', he or she only has to put $10 into the pot because they have already put $25 in before (this matches the $35 that player 4 has put in).<br><br> Once all the players still playing have put the same amount of money/chips into the pot, the round ends. If a player wants to 'call' on their turn in a round, they simply say 'call' and say nothing else.<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"ir"</b></em>.</p>

<p>In this online exercise you will learn English vocabulary and phrases that are used after you have served/given customers their food to when the customers leave the restaurant. You'll learn professional and polite phrases for asking if they want dessert, giving them their bill/check, them paying the bill/check and saying goodbye.</p>

<p>This is the third part of three online exercises on English vocabulary for restaurant waiters/waitresses. If you want to learn what to say when taking orders and serving food, do our exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/job_work/exercises/english-for-restaurant-taking-orders/english-for-restaurant-taking-orders.html"><b><u>English for restaurant waiters: Taking orders and serving food</u></b></a>'.</p>

<p>To learn what to say when customers arrive and serving drinks, do our exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/job_work/exercises/english-for-restaurant-customers-arrive/english-for-restaurant-customers-arrive.html"><b><u>English for restaurant waiters: When customers arrive</u></b></a>'.</p>

       
   
<p>To learn food and drink vocabulary, see the online exercises we have on the website in the '<a href="../../../../../exercises/social/food_selectionpage.html"><b><u>food & drink exercise menu</u></b></a>'.

 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation in a restaurant in Spain, a waiter is speaking to two customers after he has served/given each of them their main course dish. This conversation is a continuation of what was said in the second part of this exercise <a href="../../../../../exercises/job_work/exercises/english-for-restaurant-taking-orders/english-for-restaurant-taking-orders.html"><b><u>when the waiter took the customers' orders and served them their food</u></b></a>.</p> 

<p>Focus on the words/phrases which are in <b>bold</b> in the text and from using the context, decide both what they mean and what their purpose is. Do the quiz/test at the end to make sure that you are right.</p>

  <p><strong>That will be â‚¬65.00, please:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> If a customer is going to pay the bill/check by card, before you take their card from them you can confirm how much money you are going to take from their account for the meal. It is not necessary to say this (because they will already know how much from having looked at the bill/check), but it sounds professional to do so.<br><br>

You can also use this phrase to tell a customer how much they have to pay if you don't give them a bill/check.<br><br>

For example:<br><br>

'That will be $10.45, please.'

You should also say this for drinks as well.

If you don't ask them this and just take the plates and glasses away without asking, it is seen as rude and unprofessional by many people (especially for people from Britain, America, Australia etc...).<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"habÃ©is terminado"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Enjoy the rest of your evening:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a polite and professional thing to say to customers when they have paid the bill/check and are leaving (or getting ready to leave) the restaurant.<br><br> 

You should use this phrase if the customers have just had dinner (because it uses 'evening'). If the customers have just had breakfast or lunch, then you would replace 'evening' with 'day'. For example, 'enjoy the rest of your day'.<br><br>


If the customers are tourists, no matter what the time is, you can also say 'enjoy the rest of your stay'. Which means enjoy the rest of the time you are in the city or town where you are.
<br><br> In Spanish: <em><b>"quÃ© pasen buena tarde"</b></em>.</p>

<td>  
  <p><strong>Here's your card and your receipt:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> In English, when you give a customer something in a restaurant or bar which is for them, you normally start by saying 'here's your'. For example, 'here's your change', 'here's your drink', 'here are your menus' etc... You would say 'here's your card and your receipt' to a customer after you have taken out the money from their bank account for their meal and you are giving them back their bank card and the receipt (the small piece of paper that says what they have bought and how much it cost).<br><br>If the customer has paid with cash (notes and/or coins), when you are giving them their change (the money you return to the customer when they have paid for something with more money than it costs), you replace 'here's your card' with 'here's your change' in the phrase.<br><br>

For example:<br><br>

'Here's your change and your receipt.'

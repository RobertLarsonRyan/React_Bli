<p>In the first part of this exercise, you learnt the vocabulary used in English to talk about before people vote in an election. In this second part, you will learn (by first reading a text and doing a quiz/test) the vocabulary used both to describe when people vote and what happens after this. You will also learn the names of the different electoral systems used in elections to decide who wins.</p>

<p>If you haven't already done the first part of this exercise, I would recommend <a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/political-english-vocabulary-elections-part-1/political-english-vocabulary-elections-part-1.html"><b><u>that you do that part before</u></b></a> you start this second part. It will make doing this second part a lot easier for you.</p>

 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation where Peter continues to explain to his Spanish friend Juan the meaning of important vocabulary used to talk about political elections in English.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So what do people do on the day of the election here? Where do they vote?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'To vote here, you have to go to a <strong>polling station</strong>.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's called that! I thought a poll was a prediction of who people would vote for.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It is, but for some reason they call the place where people vote a polling station. Normally, the polling station will be in a school hall or in a church.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, they go there and vote?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah. When they are in the polling station, they are given a <strong>ballot</strong>. Which is a piece of paper where they mark which political candidate they want to vote for. After they have done that, they then put their ballot into a <strong>ballot box</strong>. When they've done that, they've voted and they leave.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How do they know how many people who could vote, have voted?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The <strong>turnout</strong> for the election is calculated by the polling stations counting how many people they have given ballots to. In some elections the turnout could be low (e.g. 35% of all people who have the right to vote, actually vote). Whereas in other elections, voter turnout can be a lot higher (e.g. around 70%).'
</span></p>

   <div class="ad_leaderboardContent">

</div><!-- /end .ad_leaderboardContent -->

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, after they've closed the polling stations and finished counting the votes/ballots. How do they decide how many seats in parliament to give to the different political parties? Is the number of seats calculated on the percentage of votes each political party gets. So if the Conservative Party gets 40% of all the votes in the election, they get 40% of the seats in parliament?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That type of electoral system (where seats are given to a political party based on the percentage of all votes they received) is called <strong>proportional representation</strong>, but it isn't used in most elections in Britain (apart from elections for the European Parliament and some elections in Scotland and Wales). 
<br><br>
For elections in the British Parliament, we use a electoral system called <strong>first-past-the-post</strong>. Each seat in parliament is for a specific part of the country (e.g. there's a seat for a town or for a part of a big city). The candidate who gets the most votes in that specific part, wins the seat in parliament for there.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So a political party could get 15% of all the votes in the country, but if none of its candidates get as many votes as those from other political parties in the places where each seat in parliament comes from, it would mean that they would have no seats in parliament?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In an electoral system which is first-past-the-post, that could happen.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, I suppose the political party that wins the most seats in parliament becomes the government of the country?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. If one political party has more seats in parliament than all the other political parties put together, they become what is called a <strong>majority government</strong>.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'And if one political party doesn't have more seats than all the other political parties combined?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Then two or more political parties have to agree to run the government together. When this happens, it is called a <strong>coalition government</strong>.'
</span></p>

This type of government is common in countries which use a 'first-past-the-post' electoral system (e.g. Britain, the US etc...).

It is not common for people to say 'majority government' in normal conversation, instead most people would say that a political party 'won the election'.

  <p><strong>First-past-the-post:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> Also called 'winner-takes-all'. This is a type of electoral system where the candidate who wins the most votes takes a seat/position in parliament (or in congress in the US), regional council or becomes the president of a country. 
<br><br>
In countries which use 'first-past-the-post' in elections, candidates from different political parties directly compete against each other to win a seat for a specific part of the country (e.g. a part of a city, state etc...).
<br><br>
This type of electoral system benefits large political parties (like the Labour and Conservatives parties in Britain). They usually get a higher percentage of seats in parliament than they do in votes in the country. For smaller political parties, this system means the opposite.

  <p><strong>Coalition government:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em>  Also known as a 'coalition'. This is when more than one political party is part of the government running a country. The reason why 'coalition governments' are formed is because no one political party in an election has won the majority of seats in a country's parliament. As a result, different political parties have to agree to work together to form a government.
<br><br>
This type of government is common in countries which use the 'proportional representation' electoral system (e.g. Germany, Spain etc...).</p>

  <p><strong>Turnout:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> In political elections, the 'turnout' is the amount of people who were eligible to vote (i.e. citizens of the country who are over 18 and who are sent a permission to vote document) who actually voted. Normally, 'turnout' is represented as a percentage of the total number of people who are eligible to vote.
<br><br>
In most countries, voter 'turnout' is calculated by either counting the number of voters who took a 'ballot paper' in a polling station or by counting the number of 'ballot papers' which are in all the 'ballot boxes'.</p>

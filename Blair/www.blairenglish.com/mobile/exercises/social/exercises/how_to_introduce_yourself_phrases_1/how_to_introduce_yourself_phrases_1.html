   <div id="introduction">

<p class="openParaArticle">It is very common to meet new people and introduce yourself (tell the person who you are). But how do you do it?</p> <p>You can just say 'Hi, I'm Simon', and in some situations (like meeting a friend of a friend) that is ok to say. But if you are meeting somebody new in other situations (like in a business meeting or meeting a new customer etc...), it isn't.</p> <p>In these situations, it is important that you use phrases in English which are more formal to introduce yourself than just 'Hi....'.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the type of phrases you use changes depending on if you are introducing yourself to a stranger (somebody you don't know) or if you are introducing yourself to somebody you have spoken to on the telephone or email before but never met.</p>

<p>And in addition to this, it is polite in the English-speaking world after introducing yourself to somebody to ask them questions (e.g. 'Terrible weather isn't it?', 'Who do work for?', 'Have you been here before?' etc...) to show that you are interested in the other person.</p>

<p>And you'll learn how to do all of this here.</p> 

       <div id="ad_leaderboard">

</div><!-- /end #ad_leaderboard -->  


<p>In this first of two online exercises on introducing yourself in English, you'll learn and remember formal and polite English phrases that are used to both introduce yourself to other people and what to say when somebody introduces themself to you. In addition, you'll also learn phrases that you can use to continue the conversation after the introduction.</p>

<p>Although the vocabulary used here is focused on business and formal situations, it can also be used in less formal situations as well.</p> 

<p>After doing this exercise, I recommend that you do the second part of this exercise where you'll learn <a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_2/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_2.html"><b><u>English phrases for both finding and introducing yourself to people you are looking for</u></b></a>.</p> 

<p>To learn the English phrases used to end a conservation and say goodbye, do our exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/how_to_say_goodbye_vocabulary/how_to_say_goodbye_vocabulary.html"><b><u>How to say goodbye in English</u></b></a>'.</p> 


<h2>It's not just what you say, but what you do</h2>

<p>Before you learn the phrases to introduce yourself in English, there is something else you need to know. Like in most countries, when you meet somebody for the first time in English-speaking countries, it is polite to shake hands with the person (with both men and women). But it is not common in the English-speaking world for people to kiss each other on the cheek in introductions.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Introducing yourself</h2>

  <p><strong>And yourself:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> 'and yourself' or 'and you' are common ways to ask somebody the same question that they just asked you. Instead of repeating the full question to them, you can just say 'and yourself?'. For example, 'did you finish the exercise?' 'yes, I did. and yourself?' 'yes, I did it also'. In the English-speaking world it is polite to ask a person questions after the introduction. It shows that you are interested in them and they are used to keep the conversation going.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"y usted"</b></em>.</p>

<table onMouseDown="changeZindex('n7')"> 
<tr> 
<td>  
  <p><strong>Pleased to meet you:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> 'pleased/nice to meet you' is a formal phrase that is used to be polite during an introduction. When two people are introducing themselves to each other, you would use this phrase after the other person who has started the introduction has told you their name, e.g. 'my name's Simon' 'pleased to meet you'. It is normal (but not necessary) to repeat the name of the other person at the end of the phrase and then say what your name is after. For example, 'my name's Simon' 'pleased to meet you Simon. my name's Chris'.<br><br>It is polite when somebody has said 'pleased to meet you' to you to respond by saying 'pleased to meet you too'. Although there is no difference in using 'pleased' or 'nice' in this phrase, this phrase sounds politer and more formal with 'pleased'. It is also possible to say this phrase after both people have said their names, e.g. 'my name's Simon' 'my name's Chris' 'pleased to meet you' 'pleased to meet you too'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"encantado (de conocerlo) / mucho gusto (en conocerlo)"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Allow me to introduce myself:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a very formal and polite way for somebody to introduce themself to another person. It is used to start an introduction and is followed by the person saying what their name is, e.g. 'allow me to introduce myself. my name's Simon'. It has the same meaning as 'I don't think we've been introduced. my name’s Simon', but both are normally used in different situations.<br><br>'I don't think we've been introduced' is normally used when the two people have not said anything before and this phrase is the first thing that is said. 'allow me to introduce myself' is normally used when the two people are already in a conversation about something (e.g. the weather, football etc...). Because 'allow me to introduce myself. my name's ...', is very formal, people often just say 'my name's ...' instead.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"permítame que me presente"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>My name's Keith:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> When telling somebody your name in informal situations (at parties, meeting new work colleagues etc...), it is only necessary to say your first name, e.g. 'my name's Diego'. In more formal situations (e.g. in business meetings, conferences, formal events etc...), it sounds more formal and professional if you tell them your full name (both your first name and surname), e.g. 'my name's Diego Romero'. Basically, 'my name's' is the same as saying 'I'm', but 'my name's' sounds politer than 'I'm'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"mi nombre es Keith"</b></em>.</p>

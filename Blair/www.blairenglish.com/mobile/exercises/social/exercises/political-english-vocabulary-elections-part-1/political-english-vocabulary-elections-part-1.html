   <div id="introduction">

<p class="openParaArticle">An election is when people vote for a political party (e.g. the Republicans, Labour, the Conservatives etc...) that they want to run (to be in charge of) their country, region or city. The vocabulary in English for political elections is neither the easiest to understand or commonly used in everyday conversations. But when you do need to use it (when there is an election for example) it's important you understand the vocabulary used about the topic/subject.</p>

<p>To help you both learn and remember the English vocabulary used when talking about elections, I have created two online exercises. In this first part, you will learn by first reading a text and doing a quiz/test the English vocabulary which is used to describe what happens before an election happens.</p>

 <h2>Exercise:</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation where Peter explains to his Spanish friend Juan the meaning of important vocabulary used to talk about political elections in English.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Are you going to vote in the election in two weeks?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, I'm going to vote. Why do you ask?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's the first election that has happened since I've lived in Britain. What happens in elections here?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, before the election all the different political parties each do a <strong>campaign</strong>. They do lots of events, meet voters in the street, pay for advertisements on the TV, radio etc...'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They do campaigns to convince people to vote for them in the election?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah. People from the different political parties also participate in debates normally on television before the election as well.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What are those?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'A <strong>debate</strong> is where candidates from the different political parties appear together in front of the public and are asked questions and then criticise each other.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, <strong>candidates</strong> is the name for the members of the political parties who want to serve in parliament or congress?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right. They are the people who are actually <strong>running for</strong> election, who people will vote for. The candidate who wins (gets the most votes) in the election, then gets a <strong>seat</strong> in parliament.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But some of the candidates in elections already have a seat in parliament, don't they?'
</span></p>

   <div class="ad_leaderboardContent">

</div><!-- /end .ad_leaderboardContent -->

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes they do. If a political candidate currently has a seat in parliament, they are looking to be <strong>re-elected</strong>, to win their seat again. The other candidates who are competing against him or her obviously don't want that to happen.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'How do the candidates know how well their campaigns are going before the election happens?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Before the the actual election happens, different organisations try to predict who will win or lose. They do this by asking a large number of voters who they intend to vote for. The is called a <strong>poll</strong>. And political parties use these polls to see how well or badly their campaign is going.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'They do polls before elections in Spain as well. But what I don't understand is why there are two elections here this year. There's the election for the government in two weeks and then the election in November to decide if Britain stays or leaves the European Union?'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'But what is happening in November is not an election, it's a <strong>referendum</strong>.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What's the difference? People have to vote in both.'
</span></p>

 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In an election, people vote for a political party to be in charge of the government or a council. In a referendum, people don't directly vote for a political party, but on an issue or proposal. Like should Britain be in the European Union or should guns be made illegal/banned in the country.'

  <p><strong>Seat:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> In politics, a 'seat' means a position in parliament, congress or a council. In most countries, 'seats' are awarded to the political candidates who obtained the most votes during an election.
<br><br>
In English, when 'seat' is used with this meaning, it is normally followed by 'in' then the name of political institution it is in (e.g. the House of Commons, the Senate, the city council etc...).

For example:
<br><br>

In politics, 'polls' are often done to predict which political party will win an election, a particular seat in parliament (or congress in the US) or what issues are important.
<br><br>
Political parties use 'polls' to help them during their campaign before elections. From 'polls', they can decide what issues to talk about and what areas of the country they should focus on.</p>

Most 'candidates' in elections come from political parties (e.g. the Republican Party, the Labour Party etc...). To say which political party a 'candidate' is representing, you say the name of the political party in front of the word 'candidate'.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
'John Smith is the Conservative candidate for the North Leeds seat in parliament.'

  <p><strong>Referendum:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> This is when the people of a country are asked to decide what to do on a particular issue by voting. For most issues (e.g. to increase/decrease the level of tax, go to war etc...), it is politicians in parliament (or congress in the US) who decide what to do by voting. But if the issue is extremely important for the country, politicians sometimes let the people of the country make the final decision on what to do, by getting them to vote on the issue. This is called a 'referendum'.
<br><br>
An example of a 'referendum' is when the people of Scotland voted to decide whether they wanted their region to continue being a political part of the United Kingdom or to leave and be politically independent.</p>

<p class="openParaArticle">In the <a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/football_essentials/football_essentials.html"><b><u>first part of this exercise on football vocabulary</u></b></a>, you learnt the essential vocabulary for football (the names of the players, the place where they play etc...). In this second part you are going to learn the names of the movements and things that a football player does with the ball when playing a game/match on the football pitch (the place where they play).</p> 

<p>If you haven't done the first part of this exercise, I recommend that you do this <a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/football_essentials/football_essentials.html"><b><u>first part of the exercise</u></b></a> before doing this second part (it will make it easier to do).</p> 

<p>To learn the English vocabulary for talking about football competitions (like the World Cup, the European Cup etc...), do our online exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/world-cup-english-football-vocabulary/world-cup-english-football-vocabulary.html"><b><u>World Cup English football vocabulary</u></b></a>'.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: An article about Maradona</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following English article on Maradona in the Quarter Finals of the 1986 World Cup.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p><br>
 
 <div id="main_contentEmail"> 
 <p>Controversy has surrounded Maradona throughout the whole of his professional and personal life. The drugs, the weight, the women, the meetings with Fidel Castro etc… Even today, nearly 25 years after he stopped playing football he is still often in the newspapers. But there can be no doubt that he is one of the greatest footballers that the world has ever seen.</p>
 
 <p>However, in England (and possibly in many other countries as well) he is most remembered for one match. The quarter final of the 1986 World Cup, where Argentina played England. A match which showed both sides of his character.</p>
 
 <p>It was an important match for both teams, but more for Argentina, who had lost a war against the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands four years previously. The English felt confident that they could defeat them on the football pitch like their soldiers had done in the war. They had seen Maradona in the previous matches where he had scored. One of his goals was a <strong>volley</strong>, he hit a cross from a team mate before the ball had touched the ground. But he not only scored goals, he also helped others to score as well. In a different game, Maradona <strong>back-heeled</strong> the ball with the back of his foot to a team mate who then scored.</p>
 
 <p>On the day of the game, the Azteca Stadium on the outskirts of Mexico City, seemed more like an oven than a football stadium. There was hostility between both groups of fans, but fortunately no violence. Although the match itself was exciting, it is only remembered for the two goals of Diego Maradona.</p>
 
 
 <p>The first, showed one side of his character, the second, the other. For the first goal, Maradona made a run from his midfield position towards the England penalty area, whilst his team mates passed the ball towards the right wing. As he reached the penalty area, one of his team mates <strong>crossed</strong> the ball to him from the right. As the ball was in the air, the England goalkeeper, Peter Shilton came out from his goal to punch it away. But just before he reached it, Maradona jumped <strong>to head</strong> the ball, but the cross was too high. So he had to intentionally or unintentionally use his hand. The ball went in to the back of the net. Peter Shilton looked at the linesman and the referee, pointing to his hand, waiting for them to give a foul for handball. But the goal wasn't disallowed. Maradona had scored his first goal.</p>
 
 <p>For the second, one of Maradona's team mates <strong>passed</strong> the ball to him in the Argentinian half of the pitch. He turned with the ball towards the England goal and started to run. He <strong>dribbled</strong> the ball past the England midfield and defence, avoiding <strong>tackle</strong> after tackle. He made them look like stone statues. Then it was one on one with the England goalkeeper again. Peter Shilton came out of his goal again, trying to make a <strong>save</strong>. Maradona moved to his right and <strong>hit</strong> it passed him. Goal! This time none of the English complained to the referee. They were stunned and embarrassed.</p>
 
 <p>The England striker, Gary Lineker <strong>scored</strong> a goal after to make the match 2 - 1. And towards the end of the match he <strong>missed</strong> a chance to make it 2 – 2.</p>
 
 <p>Argentina went on to win the match 2 – 1. When asked about his first goal after the match, he said that it was 'the hand of god'. Argentina went on to win the world cup. But it was this match which had turned Maradona in the eyes of the world from being an excellent football player in to a legend.</p>

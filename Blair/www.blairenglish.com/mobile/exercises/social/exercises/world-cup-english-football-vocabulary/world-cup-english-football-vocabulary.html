<p class="openParaArticle">When a major football tournment like the World Cup is happening, everybody (men, women and children) love to talk about it. So, if you want to have a good conversation in English when this is happening, you need to know and use the English vocabulary connected to this competition.</p> 
<p>In this online exercise on 'football/soccer vocabulary' you'll learn and remember the English vocabulary used for the football World Cup and what it means. The exercise explains what happens in the World Cup and what the names of the different parts of it are. Knowing this vocabulary is essential if you want to talk to somebody in English about the competition.</p>

<p>This vocabulary can also be used to talk about other football competitions/tournaments (like the European Cup, the Champions League etc...).</p>

<p>This exercise doesn't look at general English football vocabulary (e.g. the names of the players, what happens in a football game etc...). To see this vocabulary, do our below online exercises:</p>

 <h2>Exercise: What happens in the World Cup</h2>
 
 <p>In the following conversation between Buck and Juan, Juan explains to Buck what happens in the football World Cup (they are talking about the 2014 World Cup in Brazil).</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Are you going to be watching the World Cup this year?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Of course I am. My team Spain is playing in it. Hasn't your team qualified for the World Cup as well?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, the United States is playing. But I don't expect us to <strong>win</strong> any games, we are not a very good team. In the last game, we <strong>played</strong> against England and we <strong>lost</strong> by 5 goals.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I remember, the <strong>final score</strong> was England 5 the United States 0. Buck, we don't normally say game in football, we normally call it a <strong>match</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'm American, so I don't know a lot about soccer. That's what we call football in America. So what happens in a World Cup?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It's a tournament where 32 national teams try to win the actual World Cup, the trophy.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So how do they do that?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Teams play matches against each other in different <strong>rounds</strong>. In the first round, which is called the <strong>group stage</strong>, each team plays in a group with three other teams. For example, in the group that England is in, there are also Uruguay, Italy and Costa Rica. And each of these teams plays one match against each other.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'OK, so how many teams <strong>go through</strong> or progress to the next round after the group stage ends?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'At the end of the three matches the two teams that have the most <strong>points</strong> will go through to the next round and the two teams which have the least points will be <strong>knocked out</strong>, they will be eliminated from the tournament and not play any more matches.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'What do teams get points for?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In the group stages, you get 3 points for winning a match, 1 point for drawing and 0 points for losing.'
 </span></p>
 
    <div class="ad_leaderboardContent">

</div><!-- /end .ad_leaderboardContent -->
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So what happens if the teams that finish second and third in the group have the same points. Which team goes through to the next round?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'When this happens, the team which has the biggest <strong>goal difference</strong> will go through. For example, if team two has a goal difference of 3 (it scored 6 goals and conceded 3 goals in its 3 matches) and team three has a goal difference of 4 (it scored 5 goals and conceded 1 goal in its 3 matches), then team three would go through to the next round, which in the World Cup is called <strong>the last 16</strong> (because there are 16 teams left in the tournament in this round).'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I've heard people call all the rounds after the group stage, the <strong>knockout stages</strong>.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes they are, because the teams left in the tournament only play one match in each round and the teams which lose are eliminated/knocked out. So, in each round from 'the last 16' until the very last match in the World Cup, which is called the <strong>final</strong>, the teams play one match to progress to the next round.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So after 'the last 16', teams go through to the next round that is called the <strong>quarter-finals</strong> I suppose?'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's right, the 8 teams that win in 'the last 16' go through to the quarter-finals. And then the 4 teams that win their matches in this round progress to the <strong>semi-finals</strong>. And the two winning teams from the semi-finals play each other in the final.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Buck:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I know that in these knockout stages/rounds each team only plays one match. But what happens if they <strong>draw</strong> at the end of the match? The final score is 0 - 0 or 2 - 2.'
 </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'In the knockout stages, they have to continue playing the match until one of the teams wins. If after full time (90 minutes) it is a draw, they then play another 30 minutes. This is called <strong>extra time</strong>. If it is still a draw after extra time, they then go to <strong>penalties</strong>, where 5 players of each team each have to take a penalty. The team which has scored the most penalties at the end wins the match.'

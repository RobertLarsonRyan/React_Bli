   <div id="introduction">

<p>In this second part of two online exercises on introducing yourself in English, you will learn and remember more formal English phrases that you can use to both introduce yourself to other people and what to say when somebody introduces themself to you. You'll also learn more phrases that you can use to continue the conversation after the introduction.</p>

<p>In addition to learning phrases to introduce yourself, you'll also learn phrases you can use when you are looking for people you don't know but are supposed to meet (e.g. people coming for a job interview, visting your company, attending a meeting or a training session etc...).</p>
 
<p>Although the vocabulary used here is focused on business and formal situations, it can also be used in less formal situations as well.</p> 





<p>If you haven't done the first part of this exercise yet, I recommend that you <a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_1/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_1.html"><b><u>do the first part of this exercise</u></b></a>, before starting this second part (it will make doing it easier).</p>

  <p><strong>Did you find us ok:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> It is polite when either meeting somebody for the first time or meeting somebody you have met before that after the introduction or greetings (e.g. hi, hello etc...) to have a quick conversation with them. This is called 'small talk' and it can about be about anything (e.g. the weather, football, work etc...). The phrase/question 'did you find us ok?' is an example of small talk. This is commonly used when you meet somebody who has travelled to meet you at your home, office etc... and has never been there before. It is basically asking them if they had any problems in finding the place. It is just used out of politeness and normally the person asking it, doesn't really care if they had any problems or not.

  <p><strong>We've spoken by telephone before:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is used during an introduction by one of the two people introducing themselves, to say that they have communicated/spoken by phone to each other before (although they have never met in person before). This phrase comes after one of the two has said their name, e.g. 'my name's Simon Ward. we've spoken by telephone before'. Normally, the other person would reply/respond with 'nice to finally meet you'. If you want to say that you have communicated by email, then you would say 'we've communicated by email before' instead. Both of these phrases should only be used if you have had communicated several or more times with the other person in the past. If you have only communicated one or two times by phone in the past, you would say 'we spoke by phone' instead. And the other person would respond/reply with 'nice/pleased to meet you'. In Spanish: <em><b>"hemos hablado por teléfono antes"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Excuse me, are you:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This polite phrase is used when you are searching for a person you haven't met before. 'excuse me, are you' is used to ask a stranger (who is waiting) if their name is the name of the person that you are looking for. The name of the person who is being looked for, always follows this phrase, For example, 'excuse me, are you Andrew Sweeney?'. If the person replies with. 'No, I'm not', then it is polite to reply to them with the following apology, 'sorry to have bothered you'. It is possible to use this phrase without 'excuse me', but it sounds less polite. In Spanish: <em><b>"perdone, es usted"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Have you been here before:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> It is polite when either meeting somebody for the first time or meeting somebody you have met before that after the introduction or greetings (e.g. hi, hello etc...) that you have a quick conversation with them. This is called 'small talk' and it can about be about anything (e.g. the weather, football, work etc...). The phrase/question 'have you been here before?' is an example of small talk. This is commonly used when you meet somebody who has travelled to meet you at your home, office etc... It is basically asking them if they have ever visited/been to the place before. It is just used out of politeness and normally the person asking it, doesn't really care if they have been to the place before or if they haven't.

  <p><strong>Can I take your name, please:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> 'excuse me, are you here for an interview?' is used when you have to find a number of/several people, so you can take them to the interview. If the person you ask this to, says they are, the next thing you would ask them for is their name (so you can tick it on the list of names you have). 'can I take your name, please' is used to do this, in a formal and very polite way. This phrase is used in other situations as well (e.g. searching for people going on a holiday tour, attending a conference etc...), but it is not normally used if you are searching for people for a meeting or a business presentation. In these situations, you would just introduce yourself to them normally (e.g. 'my name's Chris Smith'). In Spanish: <em><b>"puedes decirme su nombre, por favor"</b></em>.</p>

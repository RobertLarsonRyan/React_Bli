<p>In this second of two online exercises on complaining/problems in a restaurant, we continue to look at English vocabulary and
phrases that are used for both common problems that customers have in restaurants and
for complaining.</p>
<p>In this exercise, we will look at vocabulary and phrases used by
customers to say how they wanted a dish/food cooked, speaking to a restaurant manager
and problems when paying for the meal at the end. In addition, we will look at some
phrases that waiters or waitresses use in these situations.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Problems in a restaurant continued</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following text where four customers (Julie, Andrew, Sally & Peter) continue to
have problems when eating in a restaurant.</p>

<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 
 
<p class="timePhraseExercise">20 minutes later, the customers have just been served their main course</p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Julie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Is there a problem with your steak Andrew?'
  </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Andrew:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yeah, there is. I ordered a <strong>rare</strong> steak because I like it when the meat is very red inside and they have brought me a <strong>well-done</strong> steak instead. I don't like it when they fry it for a long time, so it is brown on the inside and the meat doesn't have a lot of taste.'
  </span></p>
  
 <p><span class="names">Julie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'You should ask the waiter to <strong>send it back</strong> to the kitchen, so you they can give you another steak. I'll <strong>call the waiter over</strong>.'
  </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Sally:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I have a problem with my main course as well. The roast chicken is good, but they've <strong>overcooked</strong> the carrots, so they are too soft and they don't have any taste at all. But the boiled potatoes are <strong>almost raw</strong>. They are so hard. It's like they haven't cooked the potatoes at all.'
  </span></p>
  
 <p><span class="names">Julie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I'll call the waiter over now. Excuse me!'

 <p><span class="names">Julie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'One of my friends ordered a rare steak and you've brought him a well-done steak. My other friend's carrots are overcooked and her potatoes are raw. Can you send them
back to the kitchen to be replaced please?'
  </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Waiter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I apologise for the steak. I'll replace it straight away. Both the carrots and the potatoes are supposed to be like that. <strong>I'm afraid there is nothing I can do</strong>.'
  </span></p>
  
 <p><span class="names">Julie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, in that case. <strong>I'd like to speak to the manager, please</strong>.'

  </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Julie:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'The waiter is refusing to send back my friend's dish. The carrots are overcooked and the potatoes are almost raw. We're not happy with the <strong>service</strong> we have
received from the waiter. He's made several mistakes with our food tonight and he's been
arrogant towards us.'

don't have to pay for it. Also, to say sorry we'll give you a bottle of red wine <strong>on the
house</strong> for all the problems you've experienced.'

  <p><strong>I'm afraid there is nothing I can do:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This formal and polite phrase is used to answer a request/demand to do
something from another person. It's commonly used by waiters/waitresses if they can't do
something that a customer has asked them to do (e.g. replace a product, change a meal,
give a refund etc...). It's a very polite and effective phrase because it suggests that
although they would like to do it for them, there is nothing they can do (although this may
not be true) because of policy/rules or the situation. It is used after the waiter/waitress has
already told the customer that they can't do it, but the customer doesn't accept their
answer. It is normally followed by a reason why they can't do it, e.g. 'could we have a
table for 5, please' 'there are no tables available, sorry' 'we only want to eat a main
course!' 'I'm afraid there is nothing I can do. We are fully booked tonight'. In Spanish: <em><b>"lo siento, no hay nada que pueda hacer"</b></em>.</p>

dish back to the kitchen. Customers 'send a dish back' when they are not happy with it
(e.g. when the food is cold, too salty etc...) and they want it replaced with the same dish
but better. For example, 'my dish should have a salad with it, but it doesn't' 'I'll send it
back'. This is an transitive phrasal verb (it has an object) that is separable, e.g. 'send the food back'. In Spanish: <em><b>"devolver"</b></em>.</p>

apologise/say sorry to a customer for something that has been done badly or incorrectly.
Although it is used in lots of different business situations, for restaurants, it is normally the
manager/person in charge who says it to the customer after they have complained about
the food or service. It normally follows 'I am really/very sorry'. For example, 'I am really
sorry. Please accept my apologies'. This phrase is only used for politeness. In Spanish: <em><b>"le ruego me disculpe"</b></em>.</p>

something that is written down on paper or a computer screen (e.g. a bill, article, plan,
invoice etc...). It is polite because it uses the verb 'to seem' instead of only 'to be' and
'mistake' instead of 'problem'. It is followed by what the problem is, e.g. 'there seems to be
a mistake with the bill. We didn't order fish'. A more direct and impolite way to say this
phrase is 'this is wrong'. In Spanish: <em><b>"parece que hay un error con"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Overcooked:</strong><br><em>(verb)</em> 'overcooked' is normally used as a complaint in a restaurant. It means that
vegetables, pasta or rice have been cooked for too long, so that they are too soft and don't
have much flavour. Normally, if a customer complains about this, the waiter/waitress will
send back/return the food to the kitchen to be replaced, e.g. 'the rice is overcooked' 'I'll
send it back to the kitchen for you'. 'overcooked' is not used for meat, where 'overdone' is
used instead. The opposite of 'overcooked' is 'undercooked' or 'almost raw' (for vegetables
only). In Spanish: <em><b>"recocida/demasiado hecho"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>We won't charge you:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is said by a restaurant manager to a customer. It basically means
that the customer 'doesn't have to pay for something'. Normally, a restaurant manager will
say this, after a customer has complained about the food or the service. By giving the
customer something they have ordered for free is a common way for the restaurant to
apologise. This phrase is followed by 'for' and then the name of the dish(s) that the
customer will receive for free, e.g. 'we won't charge you for the starters'. Another phrase
that has a similar meaning is 'on the house', but this is also used when the restaurant
gives a customer an additional thing (e.g. a bottle of wine, an extra dish etc...) that they
haven't ordered for free. 'we won't charge you' is only used for things they have ordered
before. In Spanish: <em><b>"no le cobraremos"</b></em>.</p>

you back (which is called the 'change') is less than it should be. Although this is normally
because they have made a mistake, in places where there are a lot of tourists, it is often
done on purpose (deliberately). If you are a customer, you use this verb in the passive (to
be short changed), e.g. 'I have been short changed'. It is rude to say this verb to a waiter/
shop assistant/bar person. So, you should use 'I think you've made a mistake with my
change' instead. Then tell them how much change you should have received. In Spanish: <em><b>"no dar el cambio completo"</b></em>.</p>

vegetables that have not been cooked. 'almost raw' means that the vegetables have been
cooked for too little time, so that they are too hard. 'almost raw' has the same meaning as
'undercooked'. But 'undercooked' is not only used for vegetables, but also for rice and pasta.
Normally, if a customer complains about this, the waiter/waitress will send back/return the
food to the kitchen to be replaced, e.g. 'the potatoes are almost raw' 'I'll send them back to
the kitchen for you'. 'almost raw' is not used for meat, where 'underdone' or 'rare' are used
instead. The opposite of 'undercooked' or 'almost raw' is 'overcooked'. In Spanish: <em><b>"casi crudo"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>On the house:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> This phrase is said by a waiter/manager in a restaurant/bar to a customer. It
basically means that the customer 'doesn't have to pay for something'. A restaurant
manager will say this in different situations. The most common is after a customer has
complained about the food or the service. But, they can also use it when they are
celebrating something or want to thank a customer(s). When a customer has complained,
giving them something 'on the house' is a common way for the restaurant to apologise.
This phrase follows the the name of the thing they will receive for free and the verb 'to be',
e.g 'the starters are on the house'. Another phrase that has a similar meaning is 'we won't
charge you'. But whereas 'on the house' is used to give the customer either something
they have already ordered (e.g. a starter etc...) for free or an additional thing (e.g. a bottle
of wine, an extra dish etc...) that they haven't ordered for free, 'we won't charge you' is only
used for things they have ordered before. In Spanish: <em><b>"invita la casa"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Rare:</strong><br><em>(adjective)</em> 'rare' in this context is a way of cooking a steak (beef which is normally fried). It
means that a steak is cooked for very little time, so the meat is still very red on the inside.
In restaurants when you order/ask for steak, the waiter/waitress will ask you 'how do you
want it done?' This means 'how long do you want the chef to cook the steak for?'. For
example, 'I'd like my steak rare please'. If you don't want to have the steak 'rare', there are
three other ways of cooking it: 'medium rare' (cooked for a little longer so the meat is less
red inside)' 'medium' (cooked for longer so the meat is pink inside) and 'well-done' (cooked
for longer so the meat is brown inside). 'rare etc...' are not normally used for other types of
beef or meat (e.g. lamb, chicken, pork etc...). For these other types of meat, if you want to
complain that meat hasn't been cooked enough, you use 'underdone', e.g. 'the pork is
underdone it's very chewy'. In Spanish: <em><b>"poco hecho"</b></em>.</p>

'average', 'poor' and 'terrible' ( e.g. 'the service was poor'). In addition to the 'service', when
people give their opinion about a restaurant, they also use the word 'food' to talk about the

happens when the cost of the products are more expensive on the bill/check than they

'I have been overcharged'. This is not a very polite verb to use. So, if this happens to you, you should try to be polite and tell the
waiter/shop assistant/bar person 'I think you've made a mistake' and tell them how much
something should be or what you haven't had or don't have. This verb is also used with the

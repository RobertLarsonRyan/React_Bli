   <div id="introduction">

<p class="openParaArticle">How do you say goodbye to people in English? It sounds easy to do, you just say 'goodbye'. And that's what you do. But what do you say before 'goodbye'? In English, what you say when ending a conversation with somebody depends on what the other person says to you. So if somebody says to you 'It was a pleasure meeting you', you should reply by saying 'And you to'. In addition, what you say changes if you have met the person before or not.</p>


<p>Knowing what polite phrases to use (and what phrases people will use with you) is really important to end a conversation in English (especially in business). Because it is the last thing the person you are having the conversation with will remember from it.</p> 

<p>And this is what you'll learn here.</p>



<p>In this online exercise on saying goodbye, you will learn and remember some polite phrases that are commonly used in English when saying goodbye in business and professional situations. You'll learn phrases to use with both people you both know well and with people you have met for the first time. You'll also learn how to <b>politely</b> tell the person that you to finish the conversation with them or leave. </p>


<p>To learn the English phrases used to introduce yourself to people you don't know, do our exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_1/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_1.html"><b><u>How to introduce yourself in English</u></b></a>'.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: Saying goodbye</h2>

  <p><strong>Is heading off now:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is a common and informal way of saying 'is going now' or 'is leaving now'. This phrase is used to first tell/announce that a person is going to leave. It can be used by either the person who is leaving (I'm heading off now) or by another (third) person (Roger, Sally is heading off now). This is an informal phrase, so shouldn't be used in very formal situations (where 'I am going/leaving now' are better phrases to use). In Spanish: <em><b>"se va ahora"</b></em>.</p>

If something has gone wrong while the person who is leaving has been with you, it is polite to apologise to them again about it when you are staying goodbye to them. We use 'sorry again about the' to do this. This phrase is followed by the name of the thing that went wrong, e.g. 'sorry again about the hotel reservation'. It is polite for the other person who is leaving to respond/answer by saying 'no problem' or 'don't worry about it'.  In Spanish: <em><b>"lamento de nuevo por"</b></em>.</p>

  <p><strong>I'll let you know about:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> Normally when you meet people for business you agreed to do things in the future for them (like organise a meeting, obtain some information, make a decision about something). If this is important, you should confirm (or reconfirm) that you are going to do it when you are saying goodbye to the person. You can use 'I'll let you know about' to do this. This is used when you have agreed to confirm something with the other person. The phrase should be followed by what you are going to confirm and by when, e.g. 'I'll let you know about the date of the next meeting by Friday'. If you agreed to send them some files/documents then you would you 'I'll send ' instead of 'I'll let you know about', e.g. 'I'll send you a copy of the contract before the end of the day'.  In Spanish: <em><b>"te informaré sobre"</b></em>.</p>

The other person will reply/respond to this phrase by saying either 'and you too' or 'the pleasure was mine' (which is very formal). For example, 'it was a pleasure meeting you' 'and you too'.

You can use this phrase to do it. You can thank the other person for whatever reason. So, you can say 'thank you for looking after me', 'thank you for organising the meeting', 'thank you for helping me with the report' etc... The other person will reply/respond by saying 'it was my pleasure' (which is formal) or 'it was no problem'.  In Spanish: <em><b>"gracias por cuidar de mí"</b></em>.</p>

You would say this phrase directly after the other person has apologised for something going wrong. For example, 'sorry again about the hotel reservation' 'it was no problem'.

  <p><strong>Anyway:</strong><br><em>(adverb)</em> This is a very commonly used word that is used when you want to change the subject or topic of a conversation. In this context it is used when you are talking to somebody about another topic, but you want to tell them that you have to leave. For example, 'that should be no problem, I think it will work. anyway, I have to go now. it was good seeing you again'. It can be used in any situation where you want to change the topic/subject, not just when you want to introduce the topic of having to leave. In Spanish: <em><b>"bueno"</b></em>.</p>

<p class="openParaArticle">In both business and private life it is very common to meet new people. Often, you will you be introduced to new people by somebody who already knows them (e.g. a friend will introduce you to one of their friends you haven't met before). In English, there are different polite phrases that are used to both introduce people together and how to respond/answer when being introduced. Also, there are phrases which can be used to say that you already know somebody when being introduced.</p> 

<p>And you'll learn how to do all of this here.</p> 

<p>In this online exercise on introduction phrases in English, you'll learn and remember phrases that you can use to introduce one person to another person. In addition, you'll also learn what phrases to use and things to say when you are being introduced to somebody by another person.

<p>Although the vocabulary used here is focused on business and formal situations, it can also be used in less formal situations as well.</p>

 

<h2>It's not just what you say, but what you do</h2>

<p>Before you learn the phrases to introduce people, there is something else you need to know. Like in most countries, when you meet somebody for the first time in English-speaking countries, it is polite to shake hands with the person (with both men and women). But it is not common in the English-speaking world for people to kiss each other on the cheek in introductions.</p> 

<p>To learn the English phrases used to introduce yourself to people you don't know, do our exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_1/how_to_introduce_yourself_phrases_1.html"><b><u>How to introduce yourself in English</u></b></a>'.</p>  

<p>To learn the English phrases used to end a conservation and say goodbye, do our exercise on '<a href="../../../../../exercises/social/exercises/how_to_say_goodbye_vocabulary/how_to_say_goodbye_vocabulary.html"><b><u>How to say goodbye to people in English</u></b></a>'.</p>

  <p><strong>You already know:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This phrase is used in an introduction when the person introducing two people to each other knows or thinks that the two people already know each other. You would only use this phrase in a situation where there is a mixture of people who the person you are introducing both does and doesn't know. In this situation, it is polite to introduce the person to everybody (both the people they know and don't know) and this is when this phrase is used. You always have to follow 'you already know' with the name of the person you are introducing someone to, e.g. 'you already know Peter'.<br><br>Another phrase that is similar is 'you have already met', but 'you have already met' is only used when the two people met for the first time earlier that day, and 'you already know' is normally used when you know that the two people you are introducing to each other have known each other for longer. Normally, after using 'you already know', the person being introduced would confirm this by  saying 'yes, I do' or 'yes, we've met before' and then say hello and shake hands. For example, 'you already know Peter' 'yes, I do. hello Peter' 'hello Simon'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"usted ya lo conoce"</b></em>.</p>

<tr> 
<td>  
  <p><strong>I don't believe you know:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> This is a formal and polite way to introduce two people to each other. It is basically a different way of saying 'let me introduce you to' or 'this is' ('this is' sounds more informal than the other two phrases, but is commonly used in formal situations as well). All three phrases are used when you think that the two people being introduced don't know each other. With the first introduction, you have to say the name of the person who you are introducing in front of all of these three phrases and then the name of the person they are being introduced to after the phrases, e.g. 'Simon, I don't believe you know Chris'.<br><br>When introducing a person to a group of people, after the first introduction, it is not necessary to say the name of the person you are introducing in front of the phrase again, e.g, 'I don’t believe you know Rachel Sharpe'. You can also say what the job/position of the person you are introducing them to is (added after the name). For example, 'I don’t believe you know Rachel Sharpe, our head of marketing' or 'Simon, I don’t believe you know Chris, who is a sales manager for Mercedes'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>" no creo que lo conozca"</b></em>.</p>

With the first introduction, you have to say the name of the person who you are introducing in front of all of these three phrases and then the name of the person they are being introduced to after the phrases, e.g. 'Simon, this is Chris'. <br><br>When introducing a person to a group of people, after the first introduction, it is not necessary to say the name of the person you are introducing in front of the phrase again, e.g, 'this is Rachel Sharpe'. You can also say what the job of the person you are introducing them to is (added after the name). For example, 'this is Rachel Sharpe, our head of marketing' or 'Simon, this is Chris, who is a sales manager for Mercedes'.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"le prensento al"</b></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Call me:</strong><br><em>(phrase)</em> In some formal or business situations (especially when being introduced to important clients or people), a person may be introduced by their formal name (e.g. Mr Ward, Mrs Jones etc...) instead of their first name (e.g. Rebecca) or their full name (e.g. Rebecca Ward). For example, 'Simon, let me introduce you to Mrs Ward'.<br><br>If somebody is introduced to you by their formal name, you have to call them by this formal name (e.g. 'Simon, let me introduce you to Mrs Ward' 'pleased to meet you Mrs Ward'). But in the English-speaking world it is polite and normal for the person who has been introduced by their formal name to give the other person permission to call them by their first name. This is done by saying 'call me' followed by their first name (e.g. 'call me Rebecca'). For example, 'Simon, let me introduce you to Mrs Ward' 'pleased to meet you Mrs Ward' 'call me Rebecca'.<br><br>If a person is introduced to you by their full name (e.g. Rebecca Ward), it is normal just to call them by their first name afterwards.<br><br>In Spanish: <em><b>"puedes llamarme"</b></em>.</p>

<p class="openParaArticle">Information Technology (IT) is an important part of any business. Companies normally have a lot of computers that are able to communicate between each other. These computers are able to communicate because they are on a 'computer network'. Although most people have heard about computers networks, they don't know or maybe even don't care what they are and what they actually do. But it is good to have a basic knowledge of what a computer network is, especially when there are problems with it.</p>
<p>In this online exercise on computer networks, we will look at the English vocabulary that is used when talking about computer networks in an office/work environment. We will also look at the names of the different devices (electronic machines) that are used on a computer network and how they work together.</p>

 <h2>Exercise: How a computer network works</h2>
 
 <p>Read the following conversation between Juan and Peter. Peter is explaining to Juan how the computer network at their office works.</p>
<p>From the context, try to guess what the meaning of the words/phrases in <strong>bold</strong> are. Then do the quiz at the end to check if you are right.</p>
 

 
  <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'I know that it sounds stupid, but how is it possible that I can open the same word document on any of the <strong>workstations</strong> in the office. It doesn't matter which computer I'm on here, I can still open it.'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'That's because all the computers or workstations in the office are connected to each other in a network. For our office, this network is called a <strong>LAN</strong> which is an abbreviation of 'Local Area Network'.'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So every computer I use in the office can access or open any file or document on my computer?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No, they can't. You can only open files and documents from any computer/workstation you use here, when the file or document is saved on a <strong>server</strong> and not on your computer. A server is basically a powerful computer on the network which is dedicated to doing one thing, like storing files, or connecting to the internet or running an application etc... All the computers or workstations that people use at their desks can connect to these servers. Any application or file which people want to be shared or used by multiple computers are stored or put on to a server.<br><br>If you don't want to share a file with anybody, you can save or store it to the <strong>local drive</strong> of your computer or laptop. A local drive is the hard drive on your computer. Keeping a file on only your computer's local drive means that you can't open the file from another computer and if the computer breaks, the file is lost. So it's better to save it to your own personal folders on a <strong>network drive</strong>. This is like a local personal drive for each user of a network, but all files are stored on a file server, a server dedicated to saving/storing files.<br><br>In addition, they are all <strong>backed up</strong> regularly. So even if the file server breaks down, there will always be a copy of all the files or documents stored on a different file server.'
    </span></p>
    
                    
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So how does my computer access and open the word document on the file server?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, your computer is connected to the LAN or office's computer network by an <strong>ethernet cable</strong> at the back of the computer. The ethernet cable is used to send and receive all the data from the computer to the server, other computers, the internet etc...'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Like emails or web pages?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Yes, when you open a document on a server, the ethernet cable sends the request to the file server and the file server sends the data in the file to your computer through the ethernet cable to your computer. This data comes to your computer in what is called <strong>packets</strong>. For example, when a file server sends a word document that is on a network drive to your computer, the document is not sent all together, but is divided into small parts which are then sent one by one. When these small parts or packets reach your computer they are reassembled or joined back together and make the document. Data is sent on computer network in packets to make the network run quicker.'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'It sounds complicated. But how does the file server know where to send the document or any type of data?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, every computer, server, printer etc... has its own unique address. This is called an <strong>IP address</strong>. So, that's how a file server knows where to send a word document.'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So, there's a direct ethernet cable from all the computers on the LAN network in the office to the file server?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'No. In most offices, schools etc..., there are too many computers or servers to connect an ethernet cable directly between each one. In our office there are 213 workstations/computers and 13 servers. It would be impossible for each computer to have 225 different ethernet cable. Each computer or server only has one ethernet cable. Those cables connects directly to a device called a <strong>switch</strong>. A switch is an electronic box that is used to direct the data traffic on the network to the correct IP address. All data is sent from a computer or server to it first. It's like a postman, when it receives the data (like an email, file, update) it reads the IP address of where it wants to go to (which is contained in the data) and sends it to the computer, server, printer on the network with that IP address.'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Makes sense. But what happens if I want to send an email to somebody outside the company?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Well, the email is divided into packets and these packets are sent from your computer through the ethernet cable to the switch. When the switch reads the IP address in the packets of data and knows that it's not for a computer or server on the LAN network, it sends the packets to the <strong>router</strong> on the LAN network. A router is another piece of <strong>hardware</strong> or device on the network that is used to send or receive data traffic from a LAN network (like in our office) to or from computers or servers which are outside the LAN network (like the internet, other companies or other offices).'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'So if I open a web page from the internet on my computer here, the data of the web page comes to my computer from the internet through the router, then the switch, then the ethernet cable and finally to my computer?'
    </span></p>
 
 <p><span class="names">Peter:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Basically, yes. The router is the first place on the LAN network that receives data from outside of the LAN network. The router often has a <strong>firewall</strong> on it to make sure that any data it receives doesn't contain a virus or words or material which have been banned or prohibited by the company. Some companies ban their staff from accessing some websites and it's this <strong>software</strong> or program on the router that stops the web page.'
    </span></p>
    
 <p><span class="names">Juan:</span><span class="exercise_dialogue">'Thanks Peter for explaining it.'
    </span></p>

  <p><strong>Switch:</strong><br><em>(noun)</em> A 'switch' is a device/machine that is used to connect all the computers, printers, servers etc... on a computer network or LAN (local are network) together, so they can transfer/move data between each other. All the ethernet cables (that transport data) from the computers, servers, printers etc... on a network/LAN are directly connected to a 'switch'. The 'switch' remembers the different addresses of the computers or servers and sends the data to the correct one. For example, if you want to open a word document on a server, your computer sends a request to connect/open to it. This request reaches the 'switch' and it reads the request (which contains the address of the server) and then sends it to the actual server. A 'hub' performs a similar function to a 'switch', but is less efficient. In Spanish: <em><b>"conmutador de red"</b></em>.</p>
